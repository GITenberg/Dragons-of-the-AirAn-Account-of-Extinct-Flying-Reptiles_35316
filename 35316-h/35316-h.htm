<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>I was a student of law at a time when Sir
Richard Owen was lecturing on Extinct Fossil
Reptiles. The skill of the great master, who built
bones together as a child builds with a box of
bricks, taught me that the laws which determine the
forms of animals were less understood at that time
than the laws which govern the relations of men in
their country. The laws of Nature promised a better
return of new knowledge for reasonable study. A
lecture on Flying Reptiles determined me to attempt
to fathom the mysteries which gave new types of life
to the Earth and afterwards took them away.</p>

<p>Thus I became the very humble servant of the
Dragons of the Air. Knowing but little about them
I went to Cambridge, and for ten years worked with
the Professor of Geology, the late Rev. Adam Sedgwick,
<small>LL.D., F.R.S.</small>, in gathering their bones from the
so-called Cambridge Coprolite bed, the Cambridge
Greensand. The bones came in thousands, battered
and broken, but instructive as better materials might
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg vi]</span>
not have been. My rooms became filled with remains
of existing birds, lizards, and mammals, which threw
light on the astonishing collection of old bones which
I assisted in bringing together for the University.</p>

<p>In time I had something to say about Flying
Animals which was new. The story was told in
the theatre of the Royal Institution, in a series
of lectures. Some of them were repeated in several
English towns. There was still much to learn of
foreign forms of flying animals; but at last, with
the aid of the Government grant administered by the
Royal Society, and the chiefs of the great Continental
museums, I saw all the specimens in Europe.</p>

<p>So I have again written out my lectures, with the
aid of the latest discoveries, and the story of animal
structure has lost nothing in interest as a twice-told
tale. It still presents in epitome the story of life on
the Earth. He who understands whence the Flying
Reptiles came, how they endured, and disappeared
from the Earth, has solved some of the greatest
mysteries of life. I have only contributed something
towards solving the problems.</p>

<p>In telling my story, chiefly of facts in Nature, an
attempt is made to show how a naturalist does his
work, in the hope that perhaps a few readers will find
happiness in following the workings of the laws of
life. Such an illumination has proved to many
worth seeking, a solid return for labour, which is
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg vii]</span>
not to be marketed on the Exchange, but may be
taken freely without exhausting the treasury of
Nature's truths. Such outlines of knowledge as
here are offered to a larger public, may also, I
believe, be acceptable to students of science and
scientific men.</p>

<p>The drawings given in illustration of the text have
been made for me by Miss E. B. Seeley.</p>

FLYING REPTILES</h2>


<p>The history of life on the earth during the
epochs of geological time unfolds no more
wonderful discovery among types of animals which
have become extinct than the family of fossils known
as flying reptiles. Its coming into existence, its
structure, and passing away from the living world
are among the great mysteries of Nature.</p>

<p>The animals are astonishing in their plan of construction.
In aspect they are unlike birds and beasts
which, in this age, hover over land and sea. They
gather into themselves in the body of a single individual,
structures which, at the present day, are
among the most distinctive characters of certain
mammals, birds, and reptiles.</p>

<p>The name "flying reptile" expresses this anomaly.
Its invention is due to the genius of the great French
naturalist Cuvier, who was the first to realise that this
extinct animal, entombed in slabs of stone, is one of
the wonders of the world.</p>

<p>The word "reptile" has impressed the imagination
with unpleasant sound, even when the habits of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
animals it indicates are unknown. It is familiarly
associated with life which is reputed venomous, and
is creeping and cold. Its common type, the serpent,
in many parts of the world takes a yearly toll of
victims from man and beast, and has become the
representative of silent, active strength, dreaded craft,
and danger.</p>

<p>Science uses the word "reptile" in a more exact
way, to define the assemblage of cold-blooded animals
which in familiar description are separately named
serpents, lizards, turtles, hatteria, and crocodiles.</p>

<p>Turtles and the rest of them survive from great
geological antiquity. They present from age to age
diversity of aspect and habit, and in unexpected
differences of outward proportion of the body show
how the laws of life have preserved each animal type.
For the vital organs which constitute each animal
a reptile, and the distinctive bony structures with
which they are associated, remain unaffected, or but
little modified, by the animal's external change in
appearance.</p>

<p>The creeping reptile is commonly imagined as the
antithesis of the bird. For the bird overcomes the
forces that hold even man to the earth, and enjoys
exalted aerial conditions of life. Therefore the marvel
is shared equally by learned and unlearned, that the
power of flight should have been an endowment of
animals sprung from the breed of serpents, or crocodiles,
enabling them to move through the air as
though they too were of a heaven-born race. The
wonder would not be lessened if the animal were
a degraded representative of a nobler type, or if
it should be demonstrated that even beasts have
advanced in the battle of life. The winged reptile,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
when compared with a bird, is not less astounding
than the poetic conceptions in Milton's <i>Paradise
Lost</i> of degradation which overtakes life that once
was amongst the highest. And on the other hand,
from the point of view of the teaching of Darwin
in the theories of modern science, we are led to ask
whether a flying reptile may not be evidence of the
physical exaltation which raises animals in the scale
of organisation. The dominance upon the earth of
flying reptiles during the great middle period of
geological history will long engage the interest
of those who can realise the complexity of its
structure, or care to unravel the meaning of the
procession of animal forms in successive geological
ages which preceded the coming of man.</p>

<p>The outer vesture of an animal counts for little in
estimating the value of ties which bind orders of
animals together, which are included in the larger
classes of life. The kindred relationship which makes
the snake of the same class as the tortoise is determined
by the soft vital organs&mdash;brain, heart, lungs&mdash;which
are the essentials of an animal's existence and
control its way of life. The wonder which science
weaves into the meaning of the word "reptile," "bird,"
or "mammal," is partly in exhibiting minor changes
of character in those organs and other soft parts, but
far more in showing that while they endure unchanged,
the hard parts of the skeleton are modified
in many ways. For the bones of the reptile orders
stretch their affinities in one direction towards the
skeletons of salamanders and fishes; and extend
them also at the same time in other directions,
towards birds and mammals. This mystery we may
hope to partly unravel.</p>

HOW A REPTILE IS KNOWN</h2>

<h4>DEFINITION OF REPTILES BY THEIR
VITAL ORGANS</h4>


<p>The relations of reptiles to other animals may be
stated so as to make evident the characters and
affinities which bind them together. Early in the
nineteenth century naturalists included with the Reptilia
the tribe of salamanders and frogs which are
named Amphibia. The two groups have been separated
from each other because the young of Amphibia
pass through a tadpole stage of development. They
then breathe by gills, like fishes, taking oxygen from
the air which is suspended in water, before lungs are
acquired which afterwards enable the animals to take
oxygen directly from the air. The amphibian sometimes
sheds the gills, and leaves the water to live on
land. Sometimes gills and lungs are retained through
life in the same individual. This amphibian condition
of lung and gill being present at the same
time is paralleled by a few fishes which still exist,
like the Australian <i>Ceratodus</i>, the lung-fish, an ancient
type of fish which belongs to early days in geological
time.</p>

<p>This metamorphosis has been held to separate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
amphibian type from the reptile because no existing
reptile develops gills or undergoes a metamorphosis.
Yet the character may not be more important
as a ground for classification
than the community of gills and lungs
in the fish and amphibian is ground for
putting them together in one natural
group. For although no gills are found
in reptiles, birds, or mammals, the
embryo of each in an early stage of
development appears to possess gill-arches,
and gill-clefts between them,
through which gills might have been
developed, even in the higher vertebrates,
if the conditions of life had
been favourable to such modification
of structure. In their bones Reptiles
and Amphibia have much in common.
Nearly all true reptiles lay eggs, which
are defined like those of birds by comparatively
large size, and are contained
in shells. This condition is not usual
in amphibians or fishes. When hatched
the young reptile is completely formed,
the image of its parent, and has no need
to grow a covering to its skin like some
birds, or shed its tail like some tadpoles.
The reptile is like the bird in freedom
from important changes of form after the egg is
hatched; and the only structure shed by both is the
little horn upon the nose, with which the embryo
breaks the shell and emerges a reptile or a bird,
growing to maturity with small subsequent variations
in the proportions of the body.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE REPTILE SKIN</h4>

<p>Between one class of animals and another the
differences in the condition of the skin are more
or less distinctive. In a few amphibians there are
some bones in the skin on the under side of the
body, though the skin is usually naked, and in frogs
is said to transmit air to the blood, so as to exercise
a respiratory function of a minor kind. This naked
condition, so unlike the armoured skin of the true
Reptilia, appears to have been paralleled by a number
of extinct groups of fossils of the Secondary rocks,
such as Ichthyosaurs and Plesiosaurs, which were
aquatic, and probably also by some Dinosauria, which
were terrestrial.</p>

<p>Living reptiles are usually defended with some
kind of protection to the skin. Among snakes and
lizards the skin has commonly a covering of overlapping
scales, usually of horny or bony texture.
The tortoise and turtle tribe shut up the animal in a
true box of bone, which is cased with an armour of
horny plates. Crocodiles have a thick skin embedding
a less continuous coat of mail. Thus the
skin of a reptile does not at first suggest anything
which might become an organ of flight; and its
dermal appendages, or scales, may seem further removed
from the feathers which ensure flying powers
to the bird than from the naked skin of a frog.</p>


<h4>THE REPTILE BRAIN</h4>

<p>Although the mode of development of the young
and the covering of the skin are conspicuous among
important characters by which animals are classified,
the brain is an organ of some importance, although<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of greater weight in the higher Vertebrata than in its
lower groups. Reptiles have links in the mode of
arrangement of the parts of their brains with fishes
and amphibians. The regions of that organ are commonly
arranged in pairs of nervous masses, known
as (1) the olfactory lobes, (2) the cerebrum, behind
which is the minute pineal body, followed by (3) the
pair of optic lobes, and hindermost of all (4) the
single mass termed the cerebellum. These parts of
the brain are extended in longitudinal order, one
behind the other in all three groups. The olfactory
lobes of the brain in Fishes may be as large as
the cerebrum; but among Reptiles and Amphibians
they are relatively smaller, and they assume more of
the condition found in mammals like the Hare or
Mole, being altogether subordinate in size. And the
cerebral masses begin to be wider and higher than
the other parts of the brain, though they do not extend
forward above the olfactory lobes, as is often seen in
Mammals. In Crocodiles the cerebral hemispheres
have a tendency to a broad circular form. Among
Chelonian reptiles that region of the brain is more
remarkable for height. Lizards and Ophidians both
have this part of the brain somewhat pear-shaped,
pointed in front, and elongated. The amphibian
brain only differs from the lizard type in degree; and
differences between lizards' and amphibian brains are
less noticeable than between the other orders of
reptiles. The reptilian brain is easily distinguished
from that of all other animals by the position and
proportions of its regions (see <a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19, p. 53</a>).</p>

<p>Birds have the parts of the brain formed and
arranged in a way that is equally distinctive. The
cerebral lobes are relatively large and convex, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
deserve the descriptive name "hemispheres." They
are always smooth, as among the lower Mammals,
and extend backward so as to abut against the hind
brain, termed the cerebellum. This junction is
brought about in a peculiar way. The cerebral
hemispheres in a bird do not extend backward to
override the optic lobes, and hide them, as occurs
among adult mammals, but they extend back between
the optic lobes, so as to force them apart and
push them aside, downward and backward, till they
extend laterally beyond the junction of the cerebrum
with the cerebellum. The brain of a Bird is never
reptilian; but in the young Mammal the brain has
a very reptilian aspect, because both have their parts
primarily arranged in a line. Therefore the brain
appears to determine the boundary between bird
and reptile exactly.</p>


<h4>REPTILIAN BREATHING ORGANS</h4>

<p>The breathing organs of Birds and Reptiles which
are associated with these different types of brain are
not quite the same. The Frog has a cellular lung
which, in the details of the minute sacs which branch
and cluster at the terminations of the tubes, is not
unlike the condition in a Mammal. In a mammal
respiration is aided by the bellows-like action of the
muscles connected with the ribs, which encase the
cavity where the lungs are placed, and this structure
is absent in the Frog and its allies. The Frog, on the
other hand, has to swallow air in much the same way
as man swallows water. The air is similarly grasped
by the muscles, and conveyed by them downward to
the lungs. Therefore a Frog keeps its mouth shut,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and the animal dies from want of air if its mouth is
open for a few minutes.</p>

<p>Crocodiles commonly lie in the sun with their
mouths widely open. The lungs in both Crocodiles
and Turtles are moderately dense, traversed by great
bronchial tubes, but do not differ essentially in plan
from those of a Frog, though the great branches of
the bronchial tubes are stronger, and the air chambers
into which the lung is divided are somewhat smaller.
The New Zealand Hatteria has the lungs of this
cellular type, though rather resembling the amphibian
than the Crocodile. The lungs during life in all
these animals attain considerable size, the maximum
dimensions being found in the terrestrial tortoises,
which owe much of their elevated bulk to the dimensions
of the air cells which form the lungs.</p>

<p>The lungs of Serpents and Lizards are formed on
a different plan. In both those groups of reptiles
the dense cellular tissue is limited to the part of the
lung which is nearest to the throat. This network
of blood vessels and air cells extends about the
principal bronchial tube much as in other animals,
but as it extends backward the blood vessels become
few until the <i>tubular</i> lung appears in its hinder part,
as it extends down the body, almost as simple in
structure as the air bladder of a fish. Among Serpents
only one of these tubular lungs is commonly
present, and the structure has a less efficient appearance
as a breathing organ than the single lung of the
fish <i>Ceratodus</i> (<a href="#Fig_1">Fig. 1</a>). The Chameleons are a group of
lizards which differ in many ways from most of their
nearest kindred, and the lungs, while conforming in
general plan to the lizard type in being dense at the
throat, and a tubular bladder in the body, give off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
on both sides a number of short lateral branches
like the fingers of a glove (<a href="#Fig_18">Fig. 18, p. 51</a>).</p>

<p>Thus the breathing organs of reptiles present two
or three distinct types which have caused Serpents
and Lizards to be associated in one group by most
naturalists who have studied their anatomy; while
Crocodiles and Chelonians represent a type of lung
which is quite different, and in those groups has
much in common. These characters of the breathing
organs contribute to separate the cold-blooded
armoured reptiles from the warm-blooded birds
clothed with feathers, as well as from the warm-blooded
mammals which suckle their young; for both
these higher groups have denser and more elastic
spongy lung tissue.</p>

<p>It will be seen hereafter that many birds in the
most active development of their breathing organs
substantially revert to the condition of the Serpent
or Chameleon in a somewhat modified way. Because,
instead of having one great bronchial tube expanded
to form a vast reservoir of air which can be discharged
from the lung in which the reptile has
accumulated it, the bird has the lateral branches
of the bronchial tubes prolonged so as to pierce the
walls of the lung, when its covering membrane expands
to form many air cells, which fill much of the
cavity of the bird's body (see <a href="#Fig_16">Fig. 16</a>). Thus the bird
appears to combine the characters of such a lung as
that of a Crocodile, with a condition which has some
analogy with the lung of a Chameleon. It is this link
of structure of the breathing organs between reptiles
and birds that constitutes one of the chief interests
of flying reptiles, for they prove to have possessed
air cells prolonged from the lungs, which extended
into the bones.</p>

A REPTILE IS KNOWN BY ITS
BONES</h2>


<p>Such are a few illustrations of ways in which
reptiles resemble other animals, and differ from
them, in the organs by means of which the classification
of animals is made. But such an idea is
incomplete without noticing that the bony framework
of the body associated with such vital organs also
shows in its chief parts that reptiles are easily recognised
by their bones. I will therefore briefly state
how reptiles are defined in some regions of the
skeleton, for in tracing the history of reptile life
the bones are the principal remains of animals
preserved in the rocks; and the soft organs which
have perished can only be inferred to have been
present from the persistence of durable characteristic
parts of the skeleton, which are associated with those
soft organs in animals which exist at the present day,
and are unknown in other animals in which the
skeleton is different.</p>


<h4>THE HANG OF THE LOWER JAW</h4>

<p>The manner in which the lower jaw is connected
with the skull yields one of the most easily recog<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>nised
differences between the great groups of vertebrate
animals.</p>

<p><i>In Mammals.</i>&mdash;In every mammal&mdash;such as the Dog
or Sheep&mdash;the lower jaw, which is formed of one bone
on each side, joins directly on to the head of the
animal, and moves upon a bone of the skull which
is named the temporal bone. This character is
sufficient to prove, by the law of association of soft
and hard parts of the body, that such an animal had
warm blood and suckled its young.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_2" id="Fig_2"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 2</span>
<img src="images/i_029.jpg" width="640" height="191" alt="FIG. 2" title="FIG. 2" />
<p class="center">Comparison to show the articulation with the lower jaw in a mammal and
<i>Pterodactylus Kochi</i>.<br />
The quadrate bone is lettered Q in this Pterodactyle, and comes between the skull and<br />
the lower jaw like the quadrate bone in a bird and in lizards.</p>
</div>


<p><i>In Birds.</i>&mdash;In birds a great difference is found in
this region of the head. The temporal bone, which
it will be more convenient to name the squamosal
bone, from its squamous or scale-like form, is still
a part of the brain case, and assists in covering the
brain itself, exactly as among mammals. But the
lower jaw is now made up of five or six bones. And
between the hindermost and the squamosal there is
an intervening bar of bone, unknown among mammalia,
which moves upon the skull by a joint, just as
the lower jaw moves upon it. This movable bone
unites with parts of the palate and the face, and is
known as the quadrate bone. Its presence proves
that the animal possessing it laid eggs, and if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
face bones join its outer border just above the lower
jaw, it proves that the animal possessed hot blood.</p>

<p><i>In Reptiles.</i>&mdash;All reptiles are also regarded as
possessing the quadrate bone. But the squamosal
bone with which it always unites is in less close
union with the brain case, and never covers the brain
itself. Serpents show an extreme divergence in this
condition from birds, for the squamosal bone appears
to be a loose external plate of bone which rests
upon the compact brain case and gives attachment
to the quadrate bone which is as free as in a bird.
Among Lizards the quadrate bone is usually almost
as free. In the other division of existing Reptilia,
including Crocodiles, the New Zealand lizard-like
reptile Hatteria, called Tuatera, and Turtles, the
squamosal and quadrate bones are firmly united with
the bones of the brain case, face, and palate, so that
the quadrate bone has no movement; and the same
condition appears in amphibians, such as Toads and
Frogs. With these conditions of the quadrate bone
are associated cold blood, terrestrial life, and young
developed from eggs.</p>

<p><i>In Fishes.</i>&mdash;Bony fishes, and all others in which
separate bones build up the skull, differ from Reptiles
and Birds much as those animals differ from
Mammals. The union of the lower jaw with the
skull becomes complicated by the presence of additional
bones. The quadrate bone still forms a pulley
articulation upon which the lower jaw works, but
between it and the squamosal bone is the characteristic
bone of the fish known as the hyomandibular,
commonly connected with opercular bones and
metapterygoid which intervene, and help to unite
the quadrate with the brain case. In the Cartila<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>ginous
fishes there is only one bone connecting the
jaws with the skull on each side. This appears to
prove that just as the structure of the arch of bones
suspending the jaw may be complicated by the
mysterious process called segmentation, which separates
a bone into portions, so simplification and
variation may result because the primitive divisions
of the material cease to be made which exists before
bones are formed.</p>

<p>The principal regions of the skull and skeleton all
vary in the chief groups of animals with backbones;
so that the Reptile may be recognised among fossils,
even in extinct groups of animals and occasionally
restored from a fragment, to the aspect which characterised
it while it lived.</p>

ANIMALS WHICH FLY</h2>


<p>The nature of a reptile is now sufficiently intelligible
for something to be said concerning
flight, and structures by means of which some animals
lift themselves in the air. It is not without interest
to remember that, from the earliest periods in human
records, representations have been made of animals
which were furnished with wings, yet walked upon
four feet, and in their
typical aspect have the
head shaped like that of
a bird. They are commonly
named Dragons.</p>


<h4>FLYING DRAGONS</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 461px;">
<a name="Fig_3" id="Fig_3"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 3 &nbsp; From <i>The Battle between Bel and the Dragon</i></span>
<img src="images/i_032.jpg" width="461" height="640" alt="FIG. 3" title="FIG. 3" />
</div>

<p>The effigy of the
dragon survives to the
present day in the figure
over which St. George
triumphs, on the reverse
of the British sovereign.
In the luxuriant imaginations
of ancient Eastern
peoples, dating back
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to prehistoric ages, perhaps 5000 <small>B.C.</small>, the dragons
present an astonishing constancy of form. In after-times
they underwent a curious evolution, as the conception
of Babylon and Egypt is traced through
Assyria to Greece. The Wings, which had been associated
at first with the fore limb of the typical dragon,
become characteristic of the Lion, and of the poet's
winged Horse, and finally of the Human figure itself,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
carved on the great columns of the Greek temples of
Ephesus. These flying animals are historically descendants
of the same common stock with the dragons
of China and Japan, which still preserve the aspect
of reptiles. Their interest is chiefly in evidence of
a latent spirit of evolution in days too remote for its
meaning to be now understood, which has carried the
winged forms higher and ever higher in grade of
organisation, till their wings ceased to be associated
with feelings of terror. The Hebrew cherubim are
regarded by H. E. Ryle, Bishop of Exeter, as probably
Dragons, and the figure of the conventional
angel is the human form of the Dragon.</p>

</div>


<h4>ORGANS OF FLIGHT</h4>

<p>Turning from this reference to the realm of mythology
to existing nature, the power of flight is
popularly associated with all the chief types of
vertebrate animals&mdash;fishes, frogs, lizards, birds, and
mammals. Many of the animals ill deserve the
name of flyers, and most are exceptions to different
conditions of existence which control their kindred,
but it is convenient to examine for a little the nature
of the structures by which this movement in the air,
which is not always flight, is made possible. Certain
fishes, like the lung-fish Ceratodus, of Queensland,
and the mud-fish Lepidosiren, are capable of leaving
the water and living on land, and for a time breathe
air. But neither these fishes nor Periophthalmus,
which runs with rapid movement of its fins and
carries the body more or less out of water, or the
climbing perch, Anabas, carried out of water over
the country by Indian jugglers, ever put on the
slightest approach to wings.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<h4>FLYING FISHES</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_5" id="Fig_5"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 5. &nbsp; THE FLYING FISH EXOC&#338;TUS</span>
<p class="center">With the fins extended moving through the air</p>
<img src="images/i_035.jpg" width="640" height="365" alt="FIG. 5." title="FIG. 5." />
</div>

<p>The flight of fishes is a kind of parachute support
not unlike that by which a folded paper is made to
travel in the air. It is chiefly seen in the numerous
species of a genus Exoc&#339;tus, allied to the gar-pike
(Belone), which is common in tropical seas, and
usually from a foot to eighteen inches long. They
emerge from the water, and for a time support themselves
in the air by means of the greatly developed
breast fins, which sometimes extend backward to the
tail fin. Although these fins appear to correspond
to the fore limbs of other animals, they may not
be moved at the will of the fish like the wing of a
bird. When the flying fishes are seen in shoals in
the vicinity of ships, those fins remain extended, so
that the fish is said sometimes to travel 200 yards
at a speed of fifteen miles an hour, rising twenty feet
or more above the surface of the sea, travelling in
a straight line, though sometimes influenced by the
wind. Here the organ, which is at once a fin and a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
wing, consists of a number of thin long rods, or rays,
which are connected by membrane, and vary in
length to form an outline not unlike the wing of a
bird which tapers to a point. The interest of these
animals is chiefly in the fact that flight is separated
from the condition of having lungs with which it
is associated in birds, for although the flying fish has
an air bladder, there is no duct to connect it with
the throat.</p>


<h4>FLYING FROGS</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<a name="Fig_6" id="Fig_6"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 6. &nbsp; THE FLYING FROG (RHACOPHORUS)</span>
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="480" height="548" alt="FIG. 6." title="FIG. 6." />
<p class="center">The membranes of the foot and
hand extend between the metatarsal
and metacarpal bones, as well as the
bones of the digits.</p>
</div>


<p>Among amphibians the organs of flight are also
of a parachute kind, but of a different nature. They
are seen in certain frogs which
frequent trees, and are limited
to membranes which extend
between the diverging digits
of the hand and foot, forming
webs as fully developed as in
the foot of a swimming bird.
As these frogs leap, the membranes
are expanded and help
to support the weight of the
body, so that the animal descends
more easily as it moves
from branch to branch. There
is no evidence that the bones
of the digits ever became elongated like the fin rays
of the flying fish or the wing bones of a Bat; but
the web suggests the basis of such a wing, and the
possibilities under which wings may first originate,
by elongation of the bones of a webbed hand like
that of a Flying Frog.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<h4>FLYING LIZARDS</h4>


<p>The Reptilia in their several orders are remarkable
for absence of any modification of the arms which
might suggest a capacity for acquiring wings, as
being latent in their organisation. Crocodiles, Tortoises,
and Serpents are alike of the earth, and not
of the air. But among Lizards there are small groups
of animals in which a limited capacity for
movement through the air is developed.
It is best known in the family of small
lizards named Dragons, represented typically
by the species <i>Draco volans</i> found in the Oriental
region of the East Indies and Malay Archipelago.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">
<a name="Fig_7" id="Fig_7"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 7. &nbsp; THE FLYING DRAGON, DRACO</span>
<p class="center">Forming a parachute by means of the extended ribs</p>
<img src="images/i_037.jpg" width="620" height="480" alt="FIG. 7." title="FIG. 7." />
</div>


<p>The organ of flight is produced in an unexpected
way, by means of the ribs instead of the limbs. The
ribs extend outward as far as the arms can stretch,
and the first five or six are prolonged beyond the
body so as to spread a fold of skin on each side
between the arm and the leg. The membrane admits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of some movement with the ribs. This arrangement
forms a parachute, which enables the animal to move
rapidly among branches of trees, extending the structure
at will, so that it is used with rapidity too quick
to be followed by the eye, as it leaps through considerable
distances.</p>

<p>A less singular aid to movement in the air is found
in some of the lizards termed Geckos. The so-called
Flying Gecko (<i>Platydactylus homalocephalus</i>) has a
fringe unconnected with ribs, which extends laterally
on the sides of the body and tail, as well as at the
back and front of the fore and hind limbs, and between
the digits, where the web is sometimes almost as
well developed as among Tree Frogs. This is essentially
a lateral horizontal frill, extending round the
body. Its chief interest is in the circumstance that it
includes a membrane which extends between the wrist
bones and the shoulder on the front of the arm. That
is the only part of the fringe which represents the wing
membrane of a bird. The fossil flying reptiles have
not only that membrane, but the lateral membranes
at the sides of the body and behind the arms.</p>

<p>Other lizards have the skin developed in the
direction of the circumference of the body. In the
Australian Chlamydosaurus it forms an immense
frill round the neck like a medi&aelig;val collar. But
though such an adornment might break a fall, it
could not be regarded as an organ of flight.</p>


<h4>FLYING BIRDS</h4>


<p>The wings of birds, when they are developed so as
to minister to flight, are all made upon one plan; but
as examples of the variation which the organs contributing
to make the fore limb manifest, I may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
instance the short swimming limb of the Penguin,
the practically useless rudiment of a wing found in
the Ostrich or Kiwi, and the fully developed wing of
the Pigeon. The wings of birds obtain an extensive
surface to support the animal by muscular movements
of three modifications of structure. First, the bones
of the fore limb are so shaped that they cannot, in
existing birds, be applied to the ground for support
and be used like the limbs of quadrupeds, and are
therefore folded up at the sides of the body, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
carried in an unused or useless state so long as the
animal hops on the ground or walks, balancing its
weight on the hind legs. Secondly, there are two
small folds of skin, less conspicuous than those on
the arms of Geckos; one is between the wrist bones
and the shoulder, and the smaller hinder membrane
is between the upper arm and the body. These
membranous expansions are insignificant, and would
in themselves be inadequate to support the body or
materially assist its movements. Thirdly, the bird
develops appendages to the skin which are familiarly
known as feathers, and the large feathers which make
the wing are attached to the skin covering the lower
arm bone named the ulna, and the other bones which
represent the wrist and hand. The area and form of
the bird's wing are due to individual appendages to
the skin, which are unknown in any other group of
animals. Between the extended wing of the Albatross,
measuring eleven feet in spread, and the condition
in the Kiwi of New Zealand, in which the
wing is vanishing, there is every possible variation in
size and form. As a rule, the larger the animal the
smaller is the wing area. The problem of the origin
of the bird's wing is not to be explained by study of
existing animals; for the rowing organ of the Penguin,
which in itself would never suggest flight,
becomes an organ of flight in other birds by the
growth upon it of suitable feathers. Anyone who
has seen the birds named Divers feeding under water,
swimming rapidly with their wings, might never
suspect that they were also organs of aerial flight.
The Ostrich is even more interesting, for it has not
developed flight, and still retains at the extremities
of two of the digits the slender claws of a limb
which was originally no wing at all, but the support
of a four-footed animal (<a href="#Fig_46">Fig. 46, p. 130</a>).</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<h4>FLYING MAMMALS</h4>

<p>Flight is also developed among mammals. The
Insectivora include several interesting examples of
animals which are capable of a certain motion through
the air. In the tropical forests of the Malay Archipelago
are animals known as Flying Squirrels, Flying
Opossums, Flying Lemurs, Flying
Foxes, in which the skin extends
outward laterally from the sides
of the body so as to connect the
fore limbs with the hind limbs,
and is also prolonged backward
from the hind limbs to the tail.
The four digits are never elongated;
the bones of the fore limb
are neither longer nor larger than
those of the hind limb, and the
foot terminates in five little claws
as in other four-footed animals.
This condition is adapted for the arboreal life which
those animals live, leaping from branch to branch,
feeding on fruits and leaves, and in some cases
upon insects. These mammals may be compared
with the Flying Geckos among reptiles in their
parachute-like support by extension of the skin,
which gives them one of the conditions of support
which contribute to constitute flight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 423px;">
<a name="Fig_9" id="Fig_9"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 9. &nbsp; FLYING SQUIRREL (PTEROMYS)</span>
<img src="images/i_041.jpg" width="423" height="640" alt="FIG. 9." title="FIG. 9." />
</div>

<p><i>Bats.</i>&mdash;One entire order of mammals&mdash;the Bats&mdash;not
only possess true wings, but are capable of flight
which is sustained, and in some cases powerful. The
wings are clothed with short hair like the rest of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
body, and thus the instrument of flight is unlike that
of a bird. The flight of a Bat differs from that
of all other animals in being dependent upon a
modification of the bones of the fore limb, which,
without interfering with the animal's movements as
a quadruped, secures an extension of the wing which
is not inferior in area to that which the bird obtains
by elongation of the bones of the arm and fore-arm
and its feathers. The distinctive peculiarity of the
Bat's wing is in the circumstance that four of the
digits of the hand have their bones prolonged to
a length which is often equal to the combined length
of the arm and fore-arm. The bones of the digits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
diverge like the ribs of an umbrella, and between
them is the wing membrane, which extends from the
sides of the body outward, unites the fore limb with
the hind limb, and is prolonged down the tail as
in the Flying Foxes. Bats have a small membrane
in front of the bones of the arm and fore-arm
stretching between the shoulder and the wrist, which
corresponds with the wing membrane of a bird; but
the remainder of the membranes in Bats' wings are
absent in birds, because their function is performed
by feathers which give the wing its area. The
elongated digits of the Bat's wing are folded together
and carried at the sides of the body as though they
were a few quill pens attached to its wrist, where the
one digit, which is applied to the ground in walking,
terminates in a claw.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 551px;">

<img src="images/i_042.jpg" width="551" height="480" alt="FIG. 10" title="FIG. 10" />
</div>

<p>The organs which support animals in the air are
thus seen to be more or less dissimilar in each of the
great groups of animals. They fall into three chief
types: first, the parachute; secondly, the wing due
to the feathers appended to the skin; and thirdly, the
wing formed of membrane, supported by enormous
elongation of the small bones of the back of the
hand and fingers. The two types of true wings are
limited to birds and bats; and no living reptile
approximates to developing such an organ of flight
as a wing. Judged, therefore, by the method of comparing
the anatomical structures of one animal with
another, which is termed "comparative anatomy," the
existence of flying reptiles might be pronounced
impossible. But in the light which the revelations
of geology afford, our convictions become tempered
with modesty; and we learn that with Nature nothing
is impossible in development of animal structure.</p>

DISCOVERY OF THE
PTERODACTYLE</h2>


<p>Late in the eighteenth century, in 1784, a small
fossil animal with wings began to be known
through the writings of Collini, as found in the white
lithographic limestone of Solenhofen in Bavaria, and
was regarded by him as a former inhabitant of the
sea. The foremost naturalist of the time, the citizen
Cuvier&mdash;for it was in the days of the French Republic&mdash;in
1801, in lucid language, interpreted the animal as
a genus of Saurians. That word, so familiar at the
present day, was used in the first half of the century
to include Lizards and Crocodiles; and described
animals akin to reptiles which were manifestly related
neither to Serpents nor Turtles. But the term
saurian is no longer in favour, and has faded from
science, and is interesting only in ancient history of
progress. The lizards soon became classed in close
alliance with snakes. And the crocodiles, with the
Hatteria, were united with chelonians. Most modern
naturalists who use the term saurian still make it
an equivalent of lizard, or an animal of the lizard
kind.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<h4>CUVIER</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<a name="Fig_11" id="Fig_11"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 11. &nbsp; <i>PTERODACTYLUS LONGIROSTRIS</i> (Cuvier)</span>

<p class="center">The remains are preserved with the neck arched over the back, and the jaws
opened upward</p>
</div>


<p>Cuvier defined this fossil from Solenhofen as distinguished
by the extreme elongation of the fourth
digit of the hand, and from that character invented
for the animal the name Pterodactyle. He tells us
that its flight was not due to prolongation of the ribs,
as among the living lizards named Dragons; or to a
wing formed without the digits being distinguishable
from each other, as among Birds; nor with only one
digit free from the wing, as among Bats; but by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
having the wing supported mainly by a single greatly
elongated digit, while all the others are short and
terminate in claws. Cuvier described the amazing
animal in detail, part by part; and such has been the
influence of his clear words and fame as a great
anatomist that nearly every writer in after-years,
in French and in English, repeated Cuvier's conclusion,
maintained to the end, that the animal is a
saurian.</p>

<p>Long before fashion determined, as an article of
educated belief, that fossil animals exist chiefly to
bridge over the gaps between those which still survive,
the scientific men of Germany were inclined to
see in the Pterodactyle such an intermediate type
of life. At first S&ouml;mmerring and Wagler would
have placed the Pterodactyle between mammals
and birds.</p>

</div>

<p>But the accomplished naturalist Goldfuss, who
described another fine skeleton of a Pterodactyle
in 1831, saw in this flying animal an indication of
the course taken by Nature in changing the reptilian
organisation to that of birds and mammals. It is
the first flash of light on a dark problem, and its
brilliance of inference has never been equalled. Its
effects were seen when Prince Charles Bonaparte,
the eminent ornithologist, in Italy, suggested for the
group the name Ornithosauria; when the profound
anatomist de Blainville, in France, placed the short-tailed
animal in a class between Reptiles and Birds
named Pterodactylia; and Andreas Wagner, of
Munich, who had more Pterodactyles to judge from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
than his predecessors, saw in the fossil animal a
saurian in transition to a bird.</p>


<h4>VON MEYER</h4>

<p>But the German interpretation is not uniform,
and Hermann von Meyer, the banker-naturalist of
Frankfurt a./M., who made himself conversant with
all that his predecessors knew, and enlarged knowledge
of the Pterodactyles on the most critical facts
of structure, continued to regard them as true reptiles,
but flying reptiles. Such is the influence of von
Meyer that all parts of the world have shown a
disposition to reflect his opinions, especially as they
practically coincide with the earlier teaching of
Cuvier. Owen and Huxley in England, Cope and
Marsh in America, Gaudry in France, and Zittel in
Germany have all placed the Pterodactyles as flying
reptiles. Their judgment is emphatic. But there is
weight of competent opinion to endorse the evolutionary
teaching of Goldfuss that they rise above
reptiles. To form an independent opinion the modern
student must examine the animals, weigh their characters
bone by bone, familiarise himself, if possible,
with some of the rocks in which they are found;
to comprehend the conditions under which the fossils
are preserved, which have added not a little to the
interest in Pterodactyles, and to the difficulty of
interpretation.</p>


<h4>GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF PTERODACTYLES IN
GERMANY</h4>

<p>We may briefly recapitulate the geological history.
Those remains of Ornithosaurs which have been mentioned,
with a multitude of others which are the glory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
of the museums of Munich, Stuttgart, T&uuml;bingen,
Heidelberg, Bonn, Haarlem, and London, have all
been found in working the lithographic stone of
Bavaria. The whitish yellow limestone forms low,
flat-topped hills, now isolated from each other by
natural denudation, which has removed the intervening
rock. The stone is found at some distance
north of the Danube, in a line due north of Augsburg,
in the country about Pappenheim, and especially at
the villages of Solenhofen, Eichst&auml;dt, Kelheim, and
Nusplingen. These beds belong to the rocks which
are named White Jura limestone in Germany, which
is of about the same geological age as the Kimeridge
clay in England. Much of it divides into very thin
layers, and in these planes of separation the fossils
are found. They include the <i>Ammonites lithographicus</i>
and a multitude of marine shells, king
crabs and other Crustacea, sea-urchins, and other
fossils, showing that the deposit was formed in the
sea. The preservation of jelly-fish, which so soon
disappear when left dry on the beach, shows that the
ancient calcareous mud had unusual power of preserving
fossils. Into this sea, with its fishes great
and small, came land plants from off the land, dragonflies
and other insects, tortoises and lizards, Pterodactyles
with their flying organs, and birds still
clothed with feathers. Sometimes the wing membranes
of the flying reptiles are found fully stretched
by the wing finger, as in examples to be seen at
Munich and in the Yale Museum in Newhaven, in
America. At Haarlem there is an example in which
the wing membrane appears to be folded much as in
the wing of a Bat, when the animal hangs suspended,
with the flying membrane bent into a few wide undulations.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The Solenhofen Slate belongs to about the middle
period of the history of flying reptiles, for they
range through the Secondary epochs of geological
time. Remains are recorded in Germany from the
Keuper beds at the top of the Trias, which is the
bottom division of the Secondary strata; and I believe
I have seen fragments of their bones from
the somewhat older Muschelkalk of Germany.</p>


<h4>THEIR HISTORY IN ENGLAND</h4>

<p>In England the remains are found for the first time
in the Lower Lias of Lyme Regis, in Dorset, and the
Upper Lias of Whitby, in Yorkshire. In W&uuml;rtemberg
they occur on the same horizons. They reappear in
England, in every subsequent age, when the conditions
of the strata and their fossils give evidence of
near proximity to land. In the Stonesfield Slate of
Stonesfield, in Oxfordshire, the bones are found
isolated, but indicate animals of some size, though
not so large as the rare bones of reputed true
birds which appear to have left their remains in
the same deposit.</p>

<p>At least two Pterodactyles are found in the Oxford
clay, known from more or less fragmentary remains or
isolated bones; just as they occur in the Kimeridge
Clay, Purbeck Limestone, Wealden sandstones, and
especially in newer Secondary rocks, named Gault,
Upper Greensand, and Chalk, in the south-east of
England.</p>

<p>Owing to exceptional facilities for collecting, in
consequence of the Cambridge Greensand being
excavated for the valuable mineral phosphate of
lime it contains, more than a thousand bones are
preserved, more or less broken and battered, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
Woodwardian Museum of the University of Cambridge
alone. To give some idea of their abundance,
it may be stated that they were mostly gathered
during two or three years, as a matter of business,
by an intelligent foreman of washers of the nodules
of phosphate of lime, which, in commerce, are named
coprolites. He soon learned to distinguish Pterodactyle
bones from other fossils by their texture, and
learned the anatomical names of bones from specimens
in the University Museum. This workman,
Mr. Pond, employed by Mr. William Farren, brought
together not only the best of the remains at Cambridge,
but most of those in the museums at York
and in London, and the thousands of less perfect
specimens in public and private collections which
passed through the present writer's hands in endeavours
to secure for the University useful illustrations
of the animal's structure. These fragments,
among which there are few entire bones, are valuable,
for they have afforded opportunities of examining
the articular ends of bones in every aspect, which
is not possible when similar organic remains are embedded
in rock in their natural connexions.</p>

<p>In England Flying Reptiles disappear with the
Chalk. In that period they were widely distributed,
being found in Bohemia, in Brazil, and Kansas in the
United States, as well as in Kent and other parts of
England. They attained their largest dimensions in
this period of geological time. One imperfect fragment
of a bone from the Laramie rocks of Canada
was described, I believe, by Cope, though not identified
by him as Ornithosaurian, and is probably newer
than other remains.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<h4>ASPECT OF PTERODACTYLES</h4>

<p>If this series of animals could all be brought
together they would vary greatly in aspect and
stature, as well as in structure. Some have the head
enormously long, in others it is large and deep,
characters which are shared by extinct reptiles which
do not fly, and to which some birds may approximate;
while in a few the head is small and compact,
no more conspicuous, relatively, than the head of
a Sparrow. The neck may be slender like that of
a Heron, or strong like that of an Eagle; the back is
always short, and the tail may be inconspicuous, or
as long as the back and neck together. These flying
reptiles frequently have the proportions of the limbs
similar to those of a Bat, with fore legs strong and
hind legs relatively small; while in some the limbs
are as long, proportionately, and graceful as those of
a Deer. With these differences in proportions of the
body are associated great differences in the relative
length of the wing and spread of the wing membranes.</p>


<h4>DIMENSIONS OF THE ANIMALS</h4>

<p>The dimensions of the animals have probably
varied in all periods of geological time. The
smallest, in the Lithographic Slate, are smaller than
Sparrows, while associated with them are others in
which the drumstick bone of the leg is eight inches
long. In the Cambridge Greensand and Chalk imperfect
specimens occur, showing that the upper arm
bones are larger than those of an Ox. The shaft is
one and a half inches in diameter and the ends three
inches wide. Such remains may indicate Pterodactyles
not inferior in size to the extinct Moas of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
New Zealand, but with immensely larger heads,
animals far larger than birds of flight.</p>

<p>The late Sir Richard Owen, on first seeing these
fragmentary remains, said "the flying reptile with
outstretched pinions must have appeared like the
soaring Roc of Arabian romance, but with the features
of leathern wings with crooked claws superinduced,
and gaping mouth with threatening teeth."
Eventually we shall obtain more exact ideas of their
aspect, when the structures of the several regions of
the body have been examined. The great dimensions
of the stretch of wing, often computed at
twenty feet in the larger examples, might lead to
expectations of great weight of body, if it were not
known that an albatross, with wings spreading
eleven feet, only weighs about seventeen pounds.</p>

HOW ANIMALS ARE INTERPRETED
BY THEIR BONES</h2>


<p>There is only one safe path which the naturalist
may follow who would tell the story of the
meaning and nature of an extinct type of animal
life, and that is to compare it as fully as possible in
its several bones, and as a whole, with other animals,
especially with those which survive. It is easy to
fix the place in nature of living animals and determine
their mutual relations to each other, because all
the organs&mdash;vital as well as locomotive&mdash;are available
for comparison. On such evidence they are
grouped together into the large divisions of Beasts,
Birds, and Reptiles; as well as placed in smaller
divisions termed Orders, which are based upon less
important modifications of fundamental structures.
All these characteristic organs have usually disappeared
in the fossil. Hence a new method of
study of the hard parts of the skeleton, which alone
are preserved, is used in the endeavour to discover
how the Flying Reptile or other extinct animal is to
be classified, and how it acquired its characters or
came into existence.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<h4>VARIATIONS OF BONES AMONG MAMMALIA</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_14" id="Fig_14"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 14. &nbsp; THE FORE LIMB IN FOUR TYPES OF MAMMALS</span>
<img src="images/i_055.jpg" width="640" height="454" alt="FIG. 14." title="FIG. 14." />
<p class="center">Comparison of the fore limb in mammals, showing variation
of form of the bones with function</p>
</div>


<p>Resemblances and differences in the bones are
easily over-estimated in importance as evidence of
pedigree relationship. The Mammalia show, by
means of such skeletons as are exhibited in any
Natural History Museum, how small is the importance
to be attached to even the existence of any
group of bones in determining its grade of organisation.
The whole Whale tribe suckle their young and
conform to the distinctive characters in brain and
lungs which mark them as being mammals. But if
there is one part of the skeleton more than another
which distinguishes the Mammalia, it is the girdle of
bones at the hips which supports the hind limbs. It
is characterised by the bone named the ilium being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
uniformly directed forward. Yet in the Whale tribe
the hip-girdle and the hind limb which it usually
supports are so faintly indicated as to be practically
lost; while the fore limb becomes a paddle without
distinction of digits, and is therefore devoid of hoofs
or claws, which are usual terminations of the extremities
in mammals. Yet this swimming paddle, with
its ill-defined bones&mdash;sometimes astonishing in number,
as well as in fewness of the finger bones&mdash;is
represented by the burrowing fore limb of the Mole,
which lives underground; by the elongated hoofed
legs of the Giraffe, which lives on plains; and the
extended arm and finger bones of the Bat, which are
equally mammals with the Whale. From such comparison
it is seen that no proportion, or form, or
length, or use of the bones of the limbs, or even the
presence of limbs, is necessarily characteristic of a
mammal. No limitation can be placed upon the
possible diversity of form or development of bones
in unknown animals, when they are considered in the
light of such experience of varied structural conditions
in living members of a single class.</p>

<p>What is true for the limbs and the bony arches
which support them is true for the backbone also, for
the ribs, and to some extent for the skull. The neck
in the Whale is shortened almost beyond recognition.
In the Giraffe the same seven vertebr&aelig; are elongated
into a marvellous neck; so that in the technical
definition of a mammal both are said to have seven
neck vertebr&aelig;. Yet exceptions show a capacity for
variation. One of the Sloths reduces the number to
six, while another has nine vertebr&aelig; in the neck;
proving that there is no necessary difference between
a mammal and a reptile when judged by a character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
which is typically so distinctive of mammals as the
number of the neck bones.</p>

<p>The skull varies too, though to a less extent. The
Great Ant-eater of South America is a mammal absolutely
without teeth. The Porpoises have a simple
unvarying row of conical teeth with single roots extending
along the jaw. And the dental armature of
the jaws, and relative dimensions of the skull bones,
exhibit such diversity, in evidence of what may be
parted with or acquired, that recognition of the many
reptilian structures and bones in the skull of Ornithorhynchus,
the Australian Duckbill, demonstrates
that the difficulties in recognising an animal by its
bones are real, unless we can discover the Animal
Type to which the bones belong; and that there is
very little in osteology which may not be lost without
affecting an animal's grade of organisation.</p>


<h4>VARIATION IN SKIN COVERING OF MAMMALS</h4>

<p>Even the covering of the body varies in the same
class, or even order of animals, so that the familiar
growth on the skin is never its only possible covering.
The Indian ant-eater, named Manis, which
looks like a gigantic fir-cone, the Armadillo, which
sheathes the body in rings of bone, bearing only a
scanty development of hair, are examples of mammalian
hair, as singular as the quills of a Porcupine,
the horn of a Rhinoceros, or the growth of hair of
varying length and stoutness on different parts of the
body in various animals, or the imperfect development
of hair in the marine Cetacea. Among living
animals it is enough for practical purposes to say
that a mammal is clothed with hair, but in a fossil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
state the hair must usually be lost beyond recognition
from its fineness and shortness of growth.</p>


<h4>VARIATION IN SKIN COVERING OF BIRDS</h4>

<p>No Class of living animals is more homogeneous
than Birds; and well-preserved remains prove that,
at least as far back in time as the Upper Oolites, birds
were clothed with feathers of essentially the same
mode of growth and appearance as the feathers of
living birds. There may, therefore, be no ground for
assuming that the covering was ever different, though
some regions of the skin are free from feathers. Yet
the variations from fine under-down to the scale-like
feathers on the wings of a Penguin, or the great
feathers in the wings of birds of flight, or the double
quill of the Ostrich group, are calculated to yield
dissimilar impressions in a fossil state, even if the
fine down would be preserved in any stratum.</p>


<h4>VARIATION IN THE BONES OF BIRDS</h4>

<p>Osteologically there is less variety in the skeleton
of birds than in other great groups of animals. The
existing representatives do not exhaust its capability
for modification. The few specimens of birds hitherto
found in the Secondary strata have rudely removed
many differences in the bones which separated living
birds from reptiles; so that if only the older fossil
birds were known, and the Tertiary and living birds
had not existed, a bird might have been defined as
an animal having its jaw armed with teeth, instead of
devoid of teeth; with vertebr&aelig; cupped at both ends,
instead of with a saddle-shaped articulation which in
front is concave from side from side, and convex from
above downwards; in which the bones of the hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
are separate, so that three digits terminating in claws
can be applied to the ground, instead of the metacarpal
bones being united in a solid mass with clawless
digits; and in which the tail is elongated like
the tail of a lizard. Yet the limits to variation are
not to be formulated till Nature has exhausted all
her resources in efforts to preserve organic types by
adapting them to changed circumstances. Birds may
be regarded theoretically as equally capable with
mammals of parting with almost every distinctive
structure in the skeleton by which it is best known.
Even the living frigate bird blends the early joints of
the backbone into a compact mass like a sacrum.
The Penguin has a cup-and-ball articulation in the
early dorsal vertebr&aelig;, with the ball in front. And the
genus Cypselus has the upper arm bone almost as
broad as long, unlike the bird type. Such examples
prove that we are apt to accept the predominant
structures in an animal type as though they were
universal, and forget that inferences based, like those
of early investigators, on limited materials may be
re-examined with advantage.</p>


<h4>VARIATION IN THE BONES OF REPTILES</h4>

<p>The true Reptilia, notwithstanding some strong resemblances
to Birds in technical characters of the
skeleton, display among their surviving representatives
an astonishing diversity in the bony framework
of the body, exceeding that of the mammalia. This
unlooked-for capacity for varying the plan of construction
of the skeleton is in harmony with the
diversity of structure in groups of extinct animals
to which the name reptiles has also been given. The
interval in form is so vast between Serpent and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Tortoise, and so considerable in structure of the
skeleton between these and the several groups of
Lizards, Crocodiles, and Hatteria, that any other
diversity could not be more surprising. And the
inference is reasonable that just as mammals live
in the air, in the sea, on the earth, and burrow under
the earth, similar modes of existence might be
expected for birds and reptiles, though no bird is
yet known to have put on the aspect of a fish, and
no reptiles have been discovered which roamed in
herds like antelopes, or lived in the air like birds
or bats, unless these fossil flying animals prove on
examination to justify the name by which they are
known.</p>

<p>Comparative study of structure in this way demolishes
the prejudice, born of experience of the
life which now remains on earth, that the ideas
of Reptile and of Flight are incongruous, and not
to be combined in one animal. The comparative
study of the parts of animals does not leave the
student in a chaos of possibilities, but teaches us
that organic structures, which mark the grades of
life, have only a limited scope of change; while
Nature flings away every part of the skeleton which
is not vital, or changes its form with altering circumstances
of existence, enforced by revolutions of the
Earth's surface in geological time, in her efforts to
save organisms from extinction and pass the grade
of life onward to a later age.</p>

<p>The bones are only of value to the naturalist as
symbols, inherited or acquired, and vary in value as
evidence of the nature and association of those vital
organs which differentiate the great groups of the
vertebrata.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>These distinctive structures, which separate Mammals,
Birds, and Reptiles, are sometimes demonstrated
by the impress of their existence left on the bones;
or sometimes they may be inferred from the characters
of the skeleton as a whole.</p>

INTERPRETATION OF PTERODACTYLES
BY THEIR SOFT PARTS</h2>

<h4>THE ORGANS WHICH FIX AN ANIMAL'S PLACE
IN NATURE</h4>


<p>We shall endeavour to ascertain what marks
of its grade of organisation the Pterodactyle
has to show. The organs which are capable of modifying
the bones are probably limited to the kidneys,
the brain, and the organs of respiration. It may be
sufficient to examine the latter two.</p>


<h4>PNEUMATIC FORAMINA IN PTERODACTYLES</h4>



<p>Hermann von Meyer, the historian of the Ornithosaurs
of the Lithographic Slate, as early as 1837
described some Pterodactyle bones from the Lias
of Franconia, which showed that air was admitted
into the interior of the bones by apertures near their
extremities, which, from this circumstance, are known
as pneumatic foramina. He drew the inference,
naturally enough, that such a structure is absolute
proof that the Pterodactyle was a flying animal.
It was not quite the right form in which the conclusion
should have been stated, because the Ostrich
and other birds which do not fly have the principal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
bones pneumatic. Afterwards, in 1859, the larger
bones which Professor Sedgwick, of Cambridge,
transmitted to Sir Richard Owen
established this condition as characteristic
of the Flying Reptiles of
the Cambridge Greensand. It was
thus found as a distinctive structure
of the bones both at the beginning
and the close of the geological
history of these animals. Von
Meyer remarks that the supposition
readily follows that in the respiratory
process there was some similarity
between Pterodactyles and Birds.
This cautious statement may perhaps
be due to the circumstance
that in many animals air cavities
are developed in the skull without
being connected with organs of respiration. It
is well known that the bulk of the Elephant's head
is due to the brain cavity being protected with an
envelope formed of large air cells. Small air cells
are seen in the skulls of oxen, pigs, and many other
mammals, as well as in the human forehead. The
head of a bird like the Owl owes something of its
imposing appearance to the way in which its mass
is enlarged by the dense covering of air cells in the
bones above the brain, like that seen in some Cretaceous
Pterodactyles. Nor are the skulls of Crocodiles
or Tortoises exceptions to the general rule that an
animal's head bones may be pneumatic without
implying a pneumatic prolongation of air from the
lungs. The mere presence of air cells without specification
of the region of the skeleton in which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
occur is not remarkable. The holes by which air
enters the bones are usually much larger in Pterodactyles
than in Birds, but the entrance to the air cell
prolonged into the bones is the same in form and
position in both groups. So far as can be judged
by this character, there is no difference between them.
The importance of the comparison can only be appreciated
by examining the bones side by side. In
the upper arm bone of a bird, on what is known
as the ulnar border, near to the shoulder joint, and
on the side nearest to it, is the entrance to the air
cell in the humerus. In the Pterodactyle the corresponding
foramen has the same position, form, and
size, and is not one large hole, but a reticulation
of small perforations, one beyond another, exactly
such as are seen in the entrance to the air cell in the
bone of a bird, in which the pneumatic character
is found. For it is not every bird of flight which has
this pneumatic condition of the bones; and Dr. Crisp
stated that quite a number of birds&mdash;the Swallow,
Martin, Snipe, Canary, Wood-wren and Willow-wren,
Whinchat, Glossy-starling, Spotted-fly-catcher, and
Black-headed Bunting&mdash;have no air in their bones.
And it is well known that in many birds, especially
water birds, it is only the upper bones of the limbs
which are pneumatic, while the smaller bones retain
the marrow.</p>

<h4>LUNGS AND AIR CELLS</h4>

<p class="center">The circles are openings of the bronchial tubes on the surface of the lung
The notches on the inner edges of the lungs are impressions of the ribs<br />

(After R. Owen)</p>
</div>



<p>It may be well to remember that the lungs of a
bird are differently conditioned from those of any
other animal. Instead of hanging freely suspended
in the cone-shaped chamber of the thorax formed by
the ribs and sternum, they are firmly fixed on each
side, so that the ribs deeply indent them and hold
them in place. The lungs have the usual internal
structure, being made up of branching cells. The
chief peculiarity consists in the way in which the air
passes not only into them, but through them. The
air tube of the throat of a bird, unlike that of a
man, has the organ of voice, not at the upper end
in the form of a larynx, but at the lower end, forming
what is termed a syrinx. There is no evidence
of this in a fossil state, although in a few birds the
rings of the trach&aelig;a become ossified, and are preserved.
But below the syrinx the trach&aelig;a divides
into two bronchi, tubes which carry the ringed
character into the lungs for some distance, and
these give off branches termed bronchial tubes, the
finer subdivisions from which, in their clustered
minute branching sacs, make up the substance of
the lung. There is nothing exceptional in that. But
towards the outer or middle part of the ventral or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
under surface of the lungs, four or five rounded
openings are seen on each side. Each of these
openings resembles the entrance of the air cell into
a bone, since it displays several smaller openings
which lead to it. Each opening from the lung
leads to an air cell. Those cells may be regarded as
the blowing out of the membrane which covers the
lungs into a film which holds air like a mass of soap
bubbles, until the whole cavity of the body of a
bird from neck to tail is occupied by sacculated air
cells, commonly ten in number, five on each side,
though two frequently blend at the base of the neck
in the region of the <b>V</b>-shaped bone named the
clavicle or furculum, popularly known as the merry-thought.
Most people have seen some at least of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
these semi-transparent bladder-like air cells beneath
the skin in the abdominal region of a fowl. The cells
have names from their positions, and on each side
one is abdominal, two are thoracic, one clavicular,
and one cervical, which last is at the base of the
neck. The clavicular and abdominal air cells are
perhaps the most interesting. The air cell termed
clavicular sends a process outward towards the arm,
along with the blood vessels which supply the arm.
Thus this air cell, entering the region of the axilla
or arm-pit, enters the upper arm bone usually on its
under side, close to the articular head of the humerus,
and in the same way the air may pass from bone to
bone through every bone in the fore limb. The hind
limbs similarly receive air from the abdominal air
cell, which supplies the femur and other bones of
the leg, the sacrum, and the tail. But the joints of
the backbone in front of the sacrum receive their air
from the cervical air sac. The air cells are not
limited to the bones, but ramify through the body,
and in some cases extend among the muscles. A
bird may be said to breathe not only with its lungs,
but with its whole body. And it is even affirmed
that respiration has been carried on through a broken
arm bone when the throat was closed, and the bird
under water.</p>

</div>


<p>Birds differ greatly in the extent to which the aircell
system prolonged from the lungs is developed,
some having the air absent from every bone, while
others, like the Swift, are reputed to have air in every
bone of the body.</p>

<p>Comparison shows that in so far as the bones are
the same in Bird and Ornithosaur, the evidence of
the air cells entering them extends to resemblance,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
if not coincidence, in every detail. No living group
of animals except birds has pneumatic limb bones,
in relation to the lungs; so that it is reasonable to
conclude that the identical structures in the bones
were due to the same cause in both the living and
extinct groups of animals. It is impossible to say
that the lungs were identical in Birds and Pterodactyles,
but so far as evidence goes, there is no
ground for supposing them to have been different.</p>


<h4>THE LUNGS OF REPTILES</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<p>There is nothing comparable to birds, either in the
lungs of living reptiles or in their relation to the
bones. The Chameleon is remarkable in that the
lung is not a simple bladder prolonged through
the whole length of the body cavity, as in a serpent,
but it develops a number of large lateral branches
visible when the body is laid open. Except near
the trach&aelig;a, where the tissue has the usual density
of a lizard lung, the air cell is scarcely more complicated
than the air bladder of a fish, and does not
enter into any bone of the skeleton. And although
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
many fishes like the Loach have the swim bladder
surrounded by bone connected with the head, it offers
no analogy to the pneumatic condition of the bones
in the Pterodactyle.</p>


<h4>THE FORM OF THE BRAIN CAVITY</h4>

<p>But the identity of the pneumatic foramina in
Birds and Flying Reptiles is not a character which
stands by itself as evidence of organisation, for a
mould of the form of the brain case contributes
evidence of another structural condition which throws
some light on the nature of Ornithosaurs. Among
many of the lower animals, such as turtles, the brain
does not fill the chamber in the dry skull, in which
the same bones are found as are moulded upon the
brain in higher animals. For the brain case in such
reptiles is commonly an envelope of cartilage, as
among certain fishes; and except among serpents,
the Ophidia, the bones do not completely close the
reptilian brain case in front. The brain fills the brain
case completely among birds. A mould from its
interior is almost as definite in displaying the several
parts of which it is formed as the actual brain would
be. And the chief regions of the brain in a bird&mdash;cerebrum,
optic lobes, cerebellum&mdash;show singularly
little variation in proportion or position. The essential
fact in a bird's brain, which separates it absolutely
from all other animals, is that the pair of nerve
masses known as the optic lobes are thrust out at
the sides, so that the large cerebral hemispheres
extend partly over them as they extend between
them to abut against the cerebellum. This remarkable
condition has no parallel among other vertebrate
animals. In Fishes, Amphibians, Reptiles, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Mammals the linear succession of the several parts
of the brain is never departed from; and any appearance
of variation from it among mammals is more
apparent than real, for the linear succession may be
seen in the young calf till the cerebral hemispheres
grow upward and lop backward, so as to hide the
relatively small brain masses which correspond to
the optic lobes of reptiles, extending over these
corpora-quadrigemina, as they are named, so as to
cover more or less of the mass of the cerebellum.
From these conditions of the brain and skull, it
would not be possible to mistake a mould from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
the brain case of a bird for that of a reptile, though
in some conditions of preservation it is conceivable
that the mould of the brain of a bird might be distinguished
with difficulty from that of the brain in the
lowest mammals. Taken by itself, the avian form of
brain in an animal would be as good evidence that
its grade of organisation was that of a bird as could
be offered.</p>

</div>


<h4>THE BRAIN IN SOLENHOFEN PTERODACTYLES</h4>

<p>It happens that moulds of the brain of Pterodactyles,
more or less complete, are met with of
all geological ages&mdash;Liassic, Oolitic, and Cretaceous.
The Solenhofen Slate is the only deposit in Europe
in which Pterodactyle skulls can be said to be fairly
numerous. They commonly have the bones so thin
as to show the form of the upper surface of the
mould of the brain, or the bones have scaled off
the mould, or remain in the counterpart slab of stone,
so as to lay bare the shape of the brain mass.</p>

<p>In the Museum at Heidelberg a skull of this kind
is seen in the long-tailed genus of Pterodactyles
named Rhamphorhynchus. It shows the large
rounded cerebral hemispheres, which extend in
front of cerebral masses of smaller size a little
below them in position, which perhaps are as like
the brain of a monotreme mammal as a bird.</p>

<p>The short-tailed Pterodactylus described by Cuvier
has the cerebral hemispheres very similar to those
of a bird, but the relations of the hinder parts of
the brain to each other are less clear.</p>

<p>The first specimen to show the back of the brain
was found by Mr. John Francis Walker, <small>M.A.</small>, in the
Cambridge Greensand. I was able to remove the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
thick covering of cellular bone which originally
extended above it, and thus expose evidence that
in the mutual relations of the fore and hind parts
of the brain bird and ornithosaur were practically
identical. Another Cambridge Greensand skull
showed that in the genus Ornithocheirus the optic
lobes of the brain are developed laterally, as in birds.
That skull was isolated and imperfect. But about the
same time the late Rev. W. Fox, of Brixton, in the
Isle of Wight, obtained from Wealden beds another
skull, with jaws, teeth, and the principal bones of
the skeleton, which showed that the Wealden Pterodactyle
Ornithodesmus had a similar and bird-like
brain. In 1888 Mr. E. T. Newton, <small>F.R.S.</small>, obtained a
skull from the Upper Lias, uncrushed and free from
distortion. This made known the natural mould of
the brain, which shows the cerebral hemispheres, optic
lobes, and cerebellum more distinctly than in the specimens
previously known. In some respects it recalls
the Heidelberg brain of Rhamphorhynchus in the
apparently transverse subdivision of the optic lobes,
but it is unmistakably bird-like, and quite unlike any
reptile.</p>


<h4>IMPORTANCE OF THE BRAIN AND BREATHING
ORGANS</h4>

<p>So far as the evidence goes, it appears that these
fossil flying animals show no substantial differences
from birds, either in the mould of the brain or the
impress of the breathing organs upon the bones.
These approximations to birds of the nervous and
respiratory systems, which are beyond question two
of the most important of the vital organs of an
animal, and distinctive beyond all others of birds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
place the naturalist in a singular dilemma. He must
elect whether he will trust his interpretation to the
soft organs, which among existing animals never vary
their type in the great classes of vertebrate animals,
and on which the animal is defined as something
distinct from its envelope the skeleton and its appendages
the limbs, or whether he will ignore them.
The answer must choose substantially between belief
that the existing order of Nature gives warrant for
believing that these vital characteristics which have
been discussed might equally coexist with the skeleton
of a mammal or a reptile, as with that of a bird,
for which there is no particle of evidence in existing
life. Or, as an alternative, the fact must be accepted
that birds only have such vital organs as are here
found, and therefore the skeleton, that may be associated
with them, cannot affect the reference of the
type to the same division of the animal kingdom as
birds. The decision need not be made without further
consideration. But brain and breathing organs of the
avian type are structures of a different order of
stability in most animals from the bones, which vary
to a remarkable extent in almost every ordinal group
of animals.</p>


<h4>TEMPERATURE OF THE BLOOD</h4>

<p>The organs of circulation and digestion are necessarily
unknown. There are reasons why the blood
may have been hot, such as the evidences from the
wings of exceptional activity; though the temperature
depends more upon the amount of blood in the
body than upon the apparatus by which it is distributed.
We speak of a Crocodile as cold-blooded,
yet it is an animal with a four-chambered heart not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
incomparable with that of a bird. On the other hand,
the Tunny, a sort of giant Mackerel, is a fish with a
three-chambered heart, only breathing the air dissolved
in water, which has blood as warm as a
mammal, its temperature being compared to that of
a pig. Several fishes have blood as warm as that of
Manis, the scaly ant-eater; and many birds have
hotter blood than mammals. The term "hot-blooded,"
as distinct from "cold-blooded," applied to animals, is
relative to the arbitrary human standard of experience,
and expresses no more than the circumstance
that mammals and birds are warmer animals than
reptiles and fishes.</p>

<p>The exceptional temperature of the Flying Fish
has led to a vague impression that physical activity
and its effect upon the amount of blood which vigour
of movement circulates, are more important in raising
an animal's temperature than possession of the circulatory
organs commonly associated with hot blood,
which drive the blood in distinct courses through the
body and breathing organs. Yet the kind of heart
which is always associated with vital structures such
as Pterodactyles are inferred to have possessed from
the brain mould and the pneumatic foramina in the
bones, is the four-chambered heart of the bird and
the mammal. Considering these organs alone&mdash;of
which the fossil bones yield evidence&mdash;we might
anticipate, by the law of known association of structures,
that nothing distinctly reptilian existed in the
other soft part of the vital organisation, because there
is no evidence in favour of or against such a possibility.</p>

THE PLAN OF THE SKELETON</h2>


<p>While these animals are incontestably nearer
to birds than to any other animals in their
plan of organisation, thus far no proof has been
found that they are birds, or can be included in
the same division of vertebrate life with feathered
animals. It is one of the oldest and soundest teachings
of Linn&aelig;us that a bird is known by its feathers;
and the record is a blank as to any covering to the
skin in Pterodactyles. There is the strongest probability
against feathers having existed such as are
known in the Arch&aelig;opteryx, because every Solenhofen
Ornithosaur appears to have the body devoid
of visible or preservable covering, while the two birds
known from the Solenhofen Slate deposit are well
clothed with feathers in perfect preservation. We
turn from the skin to the skeleton.</p>

<p>The plan on which the skeleton is constructed
remains as evidence of the animal's place in nature,
which is capable of affording demonstration on which
absolute reliance would have been placed, if the brain
and pneumatic foramina had remained undiscovered.
With the entire skeleton before us, it is inconceivable
that anatomical science should fail to discover the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
true nature of the animal to which it belonged, by
the method of comparing one animal with another.
There is no lack of this kind of evidence of Pterodactyles
in the three or four scores of skeletons, and
thousands of isolated or associated bones, preserved
in the public museums of Europe and America.</p>

<p>I may recall the circumstance that the discovery of
skeletons of fossil animals has occasionally followed
upon the interpretation of a single fragment, from
which the animal has been well defined, and sometimes
accurately drawn, before it was ever seen. So
I propose, before drawing any conclusions from the
skeletons in the entirety of their construction, to
examine them bone by bone, and region by region,
for evidence that will manifest the nature of this
brood of Dragons. Their living kindred, and perhaps
their extinct allies, assembled as a jury, may be able
to determine whether resemblances exist between
them, and whether such similarity between the bones
as exists is a common inheritance, or is a common
acquisition due to similar ways of life, and no evidence
of the grade of the organism among vertebrate
animals.</p>

<p>The bones of these Ornithosaurs, when found
isolated, first have to be separated from the organisms
with which they are associated and mixed in the
geological strata. This discrimination is accomplished
in the first instance by means of the texture of the
surface. The density and polish of the bones is
even more marked than in the bones of birds, and is
usually associated with a peculiar thinness of substance
of the bone, which is comparable to the condition
in a bird, though usually a little stouter, so
that the bones resist crushing better. Pterodactyle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
bones in many instances are recognised by their
straightness and comparatively uniform dimensions,
due to the exceptional number of long bones which
enter into the structure of the wing as compared
with birds. When the bones are unerringly determined
as Ornithosaurian, they are placed side by
side with all the bones which are most like them, till,
judged by the standard of the structures of living
animals, the fossil is found to show a composite construction
as though it were not one animal but many,
while its individual bones often show equally composite
characters, as though parts of the corresponding
bone in several animals had been cunningly fitted
together and moulded into shape.</p>


<h4>THE PLAN OF THE HEAD IN ORNITHOSAURS</h4>

<p>The head is always the most instructive part of an
animal. It is less than an inch long in the small
Solenhofen skeleton named <i>Pterodactylus brevirostris</i>,
and is said to be three feet nine inches long in the
toothless Pterodactyle Ornithostoma from the Chalk
of Kansas. Most of these animals have a long,
slender, conical form of head, tapering to the point
like the beak of a Heron, forming a long triangle
when seen from above or from the side. Sometimes
the head is depressed in front, with the beak flattened
or rounded as in a Duck or Goose, and occasionally in
some Wealden and Greensand species the jaws are
truncated in front in a massive snout quite unlike
any bird. The back of the head is sometimes
rounded as among birds, showing a smooth pear-shaped
posterior convexity in the region of the brain.
Sometimes the back of the head is square and vertical
or oblique. Occasionally a great crest of cellular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
tissue is extended backward from above the brain
case over the spines of the neck bones.</p>

<p>There are always from two to four lateral openings
in the skull. First, the nostril is nearest to the extremity
of the beak. Secondly, the orbits of the
eyes are placed far backward. These two openings
are always present. The nostril may incline upward.
The orbits of the eyes are usually lateral, though
their upper borders sometimes closely approximate,
as in the woodpecker-like types from the Solenhofen
Slate named <i>Pterodactylus Kochi</i>, now separated
as another genus. In most genera there is an opening
in the side of the head, between the eye hole and the
nostril, known as the antorbital vacuity; and another
opening, which is variable in size and known as the
temporal vacuity, is placed behind the eye. The
former is common in the skulls of birds, the latter is
absent from all birds and found in many reptiles.</p>

<p>The palate is usually imperfectly seen, but English
and American specimens have shown that it has
much in common with the palate in birds, though it
varies greatly in form of the bones in representatives
from the Lias, Oolites, and Cretaceous rocks.</p>

<p>From the scientific aspect the relative size of the
head, its form, and the positions and dimensions of
its apertures and processes, are of little importance
in comparison with its plan of construction, as evidenced
by the positions and relations to each other
of the bones of which it is formed. There usually is
some difficulty in stating the limits of the bones of
the skull, because in Pterodactyles, as among birds,
they usually blend together, so that in the adult
animal the sutures between the bones are commonly
obliterated.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Bones have relations to each other and places in
the head which can only change as the organs with
which they are associated change their positions. No
matter what the position of a nostril may be&mdash;at the
extremity of a long snout, as in an ant-eater, or far
back at the top of the head in a porpoise, or at the
side of the head in a bird&mdash;it is always bordered by
substantially the same bones, which vary in length
and size with the changing place of the nostril and
the form of the head. Every region of the head is
defined by this method of construction; so that eye
holes and nose holes, brain case and jaw bones,
palate and teeth, beak, and back of the skull are all
instructive to those who seek out the life-history of
these animals. We may briefly examine the head
of an Ornithosaurian.</p>


<h4>BONES ABOUT THE NOSTRIL</h4>

<p>No matter what its form may be, the head of an
Ornithosaur always terminates in front in a single
bone called the intermaxillary. It sends a bar of
bone backward above the visible nostrils, between
them; and a bar on each side forms the margin of
the jaw in which teeth are implanted. The bone
varies in depth, length, sharpness, bluntness, slenderness,
and massiveness. As the bone becomes long
the jaw is compressed from side to side, and the
openings of the nostrils are removed backward to
an increasing distance from the extremity of the
beak.</p>

<p>The outer and hinder border of the nostril is made
by another bone named the maxillary bone, which is
usually much shorter than the premaxillary. It
contains the hindermost teeth, which rarely differ
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
from those in front, except in sometimes being
smaller.</p>

<p>The nasal bones, which always make the upper
and hinder border of the nostrils, meet each other
above them, in the middle line of the beak.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 594px;">
<a name="Fig_20" id="Fig_20"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 20</span>

<p class="center">Showing that the extremity of the jaws in Rhamphorhynchus was
sheathed in horn as in the giant Kingfisher, since the jaws
similarly gape in front.<br />
<br />
The hyoid bones are below the lower jaw in the Pterodactyle.</p>
</div>


<p>The nostrils are unusually large in the Lias genus
named Dimorphodon, and small in species of the
genus Rhamphorhynchus from Solenhofen.  Such
differences result from the relative dimensions and
proportions of these three bones which margin the
nasal vacuity, and by varying growth of their front
margins or of their hinder margins govern the form
of the snout.</p>

<p>The jaws are most massive in the genera known from
the Wealden beds to the Chalk. The palatal surface is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
commonly flat or convex, and often marked by an
elevated median ridge which corresponds to a groove
in the lower jaw, though the median ridge sometimes
divides the palate into two parallel concave channels.
The jaw is margined with teeth which are rarely
fewer than ten or more than twenty on each side.
They are sharp, compressed from side to side, curved
inward, and never have a saw-like edge on the back
and front margins. No teeth occur upon the bones
of the palate.</p>

<p>In most birds there is a large vacuity in the side
of the head between the nostril and the orbit of the
eye, partly separated from it by the bone which
carries the duct for tears named the lachrymal bone.
The same preorbital vacuity is present in all long-tailed
Pterodactyles, though it is either less completely
defined or absent in the group with short
tails. It affords excellent distinctive characters for
defining the genera. In the long-tailed genus
Scaphognathus from Solenhofen this preorbital opening
is much larger than the nostril, while in Dimorphodon
these vacuities are of about equal size.
Rhamphorhynchus is distinguished by the small size
of the antorbital vacuity, which is placed lower than
the nostril on the side of the face. The aperture is
always imperfectly defined in Pterodactylus, and is
a relatively small vacuity compared with the long
nostril. In Ptenodracon the antorbital vacuity
appears to have no existence separate from the nostril
which adjoins the eye hole. And so far as is known at
present there is no lateral opening in advance of the
eye in the skull in any Ornithosaur from Cretaceous
rocks, though the toothless Ornithostoma is the only
genus with the skull complete. When a separate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
antorbital vacuity exists, it is bordered by the maxillary
bone in front, and by the malar bone behind.
The prefrontal bone is at its upper angle. That bone
is known in a separate state in reptiles and, I think, in
monotreme mammals. Its identity is soon lost in
the mammal, and its function in the skull is different
from the corresponding bone in Pterodactyles.</p>


<h4>BONES ABOUT THE EYES</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 492px;">
<a name="Fig_21" id="Fig_21"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 21. &nbsp;  UPPER SURFACE OF SKULL OF THE HERON</span>
<p class="center">Compared with the same aspect of the skull of Rhamphorhynchus</p>
<img src="images/i_082.jpg" width="492" height="480" alt="FIG. 21." title="FIG. 21." />
</div>


<p>The third opening in the side of the head, counting
from before backward, is the orbit of the eye. In this
vacuity is often seen the sclerotic circle of overlapping
bones formed in the external membrane of the eye,
like those in nocturnal birds and some reptiles. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
eye hole varies in form from an inverted pear-shape
to an oblique or transverse oval, or a nearly circular
outline. It is margined by the frontal bone above;
the tear bone or lachrymal, and the malar or cheek
bone in front; while the bones behind appear to be
the quadrato-jugal and post-frontal bones, though the
bones about the eye are somewhat differently arranged
in different genera.</p>

<p>The eyes were frequently, if not always, in contact
with the anterior walls of the brain case, as in many
birds, and are always far back in the side of the head.
In Dimorphodon they are in front of the articulation
of the lower jaw; in Rhamphorhynchus, above that
articulation; while in Ornithostoma they are behind
the articulation for the jaw. This change is governed
by the position of the quadrate bone, which is vertical
in the Lias genus, inclined obliquely forward in the
fossils from the Oolites, and so much inclined in the
Chalk fossil that the small orbit is thrown relatively
further back.</p>

<p>Thus far the chief difference in the Pterodactyle
skull from that of a bird is in the way in which the
malar arch is prolonged backward on each side. It is
a slender bar of bone in birds, without contributing
ascending processes to border vacuities in the side
of the face, while in these fossil animals the lateral
openings are partly separated by the ascending processes
of these bones. This divergence from birds,
in the malar bone entering the orbit of the eye
is approximated to among reptiles and mammals,
though the conditions, and perhaps the presence of a
bone like the post-orbital bone, are paralleled only
among Reptiles. The Pterodactyles differ among
themselves enough for the head to make a near
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
approach to Reptiles in Dimorphodon, and to Birds
in Pterodactylus. In the Ground Hornbill and the
Shoebill the lachrymal bones in front of the orbits
of the eyes grow down to meet the malar bars without
uniting with them. The post-frontal region also
is prolonged downward almost as far as the malar
bar, as though to show that a bird might have its
orbital circle formed in the same way and by the
same bones as in Pterodactylus. Cretaceous Ornithosaurs
sometimes differ from birds apparently in admitting
the quadrato-jugal bone into the orbit. It
then becomes an expanded plate, instead of a slender
bar as in all birds.</p>


<h4>THE TEMPORAL FOSSA</h4>

<p>A fourth vacuity is known as the temporal fossa.
When the skull of such a mammal as a Rabbit, or
Sheep, is seen from above, there is a vacuity behind
the orbits for the eyes, which in life is occupied by
the muscles which work the lower jaw. It is made
by the malar bone extending from the back of the
orbit and the process of bone, called the zygomatic
process, extending forward from the articulation of
the jaw, which arches out to meet the malar bone.</p>

<p>In birds there is no conspicuous temporal fossa,
because the malar bar is a slender rod of bone in a
line with the lower end of the quadrate bone.</p>

<p>Reptile skulls have sometimes one temporal vacuity
on each side, as among tortoises, formed by a single
lateral bar. These vacuities, which correspond to
those of mammals in position, are seen from the top
of the head, as lateral vacuities behind the orbits
of the eyes, and are termed superior temporal vacuities.
In addition to these there is often in other
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
reptiles a lateral opening behind the eye, termed
the inferior temporal vacuity, seen in Crocodiles, in
Hatteria, and in Lizards; and in such skulls there are
two temporal bars seen in side view, distinguished as
superior and inferior. The superior arch always includes
the squamosal bone, which is at the back
of the single bar in mammals. The lower arch
includes the malar bone, which is in front in the single
arch of mammals. The circumstance that both these
arches are connected with the quadrate bone makes
the double temporal arch eminently reptilian.</p>

<p>In Ornithosaurs the lateral temporal vacuity varies
from a typically reptilian condition to one which,
without becoming avian, approaches the bird type. In
skulls from the Lias, Dimorphodon and Campylognathus,
there is a close parallel to the living New
Zealand reptile Hatteria, in the vertical position
of the quadrate bone and in the large size of the
vacuity behind and below the eye, which extends
nearly the height of the skull. In the species of the
genus Pterodactylus, the forward inclination of the
quadrate bone recalls the Curlew, Snipe, and other
birds. The back of the head is rounded, and the
squamosal bone, which appears to enter into the
wall of the brain case as in birds and mammals,
is produced more outward than in birds, but less
than in mammals, so as to contribute a little to
the arch which is in the position of the post-frontal
bone of reptiles. It is triangular, and stretches from
the outer angle of the frontal bone at the back of the
orbit to the squamosal behind, where it also meets
the quadrate bone. Its third lower branch meets the
quadratojugal, which rests upon the front of the quadrate
bone, as in Iguanodon, and is unlike Dimorphodon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in its connexions. In that genus the supra-temporal
bone, or post-orbital bone, appears to rest upon the
post-frontal and connect it with the quadrato-jugal.
In Dimorphodon the malar bone is entirely removed
from the quadrate, but in Pterodactylus it meets its
articular end. Between the post-frontal bone above
and the quadrato-jugal bone below is a small lunate
opening, which represents the lateral temporal
vacuity; and so far, this is a reptilian character.
But if the thin post-frontal bone were absorbed,
Pterodactylus would resemble birds. There is no
evidence that the quadrate bone is free in any
Ornithosaurs, as it is in all birds, while in Dimorphodon
it unites by suture with the squamosal bone.
In Ornithostoma the lateral temporal vacuity is little
more than a slit between the quadrate bone below,
the quadrato-jugal in front, and what may be the
post-frontal bone behind (see <a href="#Fig_2">Fig. 2, p. 12</a>).</p>


<h4>BONES ABOUT THE BRAIN</h4>

<p>The bones containing the brain appear to be the
same as form the brain case in birds. The form of
the back of the skull varies in two ways. First it
may be flat above and flat at the back, when the
back of the head appears to be square. This condition
is seen in all the long-tailed genera, such as
Campylognathus from the Lias and Rhamphorhynchus,
and is associated with a high position for the
upper temporal bar. Secondly, the back of the head
may be rounded convexly, both above and behind.
That condition is seen in the short-tailed genera,
such as Pterodactylus. But in the large Cretaceous
types, such as Ornithocheirus and Ornithostoma,
the superior longitudinal ridge which runs back in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
the middle line of the face becomes elevated and
compressed from side to side at the back of the head
as a narrow deep crest, prolonged backward over the
neck vertebr&aelig; for some inches of length. All these
three types are paralleled more or less in birds which
have the back of the head square like the Heron, or
rounded like the Woodpecker; or crested, though the
crest of the Cormorant is not quite identical with
Ornithocheirus, being a distinct bone at the back of
the head in the bird which never blends with the
skull. In so far as the crest is reptilian it suggests
the remarkable crest of the Chameleon. In the
structure of the back of the skull the bones are a
modification of the reptilian type of Hatteria in
the Lias genus Campylognathus, but the reptilian
characters appear to be lost in the less perfectly
preserved skulls of Cretaceous genera.</p>

<p>The palate is well known in the chief groups of
Ornithosaurs, such as Campylognathus, Scaphognathus,
and Cycnorhamphus.</p>

<p>Mr. E. T. Newton, <small>F.R.S.</small>, has shown that in the
English skull from the Lias of Whitby, the forms of
the bones are similar to the palate in birds and unlike
the conditions in reptiles. There is one feature, however,
which may indicate a resemblance to Dicynodon
and other fossil reptiles from South Africa. A
slender bone extends from the base of the brain case,
named the basi-sphenoid bone, outward and forward
to the inner margin of the quadrate bone (<a href="#Fig_22">Fig. 22</a>).
A bone is found thus placed in those South African
Reptiles, which show many resemblances to the Monotreme
and Marsupial Mammals. It is not an ordinary
element of the skeleton and is unknown in living
animals of any kind in that position. It has been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
thought possible that it may represent one of the
bones which among mammals are diminutive and
are included in the internal ear. The resemblance
may have some interest hereafter, as helping to show
that certain affinities of the Ornithosaurs may lie
outside the groups of existing reptiles. Instead of
being directed transversely outward, as in the palatal
region of <i>Dicynodon lacerticeps</i>, they diverge outward
and forward to the inner border of the articulation
for the lower jaw which is upon the quadrate
bone.</p>

</div>



<h4>BONES OF THE PALATE</h4>

<p>There is a pair of bones which extend forward
from these inner articular borders of the quadrate
bones, and converge in a long <b>V</b>-shape till they
merge in the hard palate formed by the bones of the
front of the beak, named intermaxillary and maxillary
bones. The limits of the bones of the palate are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
not distinct, but there can be no doubt that the front
of the <b>V</b> is the bone named vomer, that the palatine
bones are at its sides, and that its hinder parts are
the pterygoid bones as in birds. There is a long,
wide, four-sided, open space in the middle of the
palate, between the vomer and the basi-sphenoid
bone, unlike anything in birds or other animals.</p>

<p>Professor Marsh, in a figure of the palate in the
great skull of the toothless Pterodactyle named Ornithostoma
(Pteranodon), from the Chalk of Kansas,
found a large oval vacuity in this region of the palate.
In that genus the pterygoid bones meet each other
between the quadrate bones as in Dicynodon (<a href="#Fig_73">Fig. 73,
p. 182</a>). Hence the great palatal vacuity here seen in
the Ornithosaur is paralleled by the small vacuity in
the South African reptile, which is sometimes distinct
and sometimes partly separated from the anterior
part of the vacuity which forms the openings of the
nostrils on the palate.</p>

<p>The Solenhofen skulls which give any evidence of
the palate are exposed in side view only, and the
bones, imperfectly seen through the lateral vacuities,
are displaced by crushing. They include long strips
like the vomerine bones in the Lias fossil, and they
diverge in the same way as they extend back to the
quadrate bones. The oblique division into vomer in
front and pterygoid bone behind is shown by Goldfuss
in his original figure of Scaphognathus. Thus
there is some reason for believing that all Ornithosaurs
have the palate formed upon the same general plan,
which is on the whole peculiar to the group, especially
in not having the palatal openings of the nares
divided in the middle line. It would appear probable
that the short-tailed animals have the pterygoid bones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
meeting in the middle line and triangular; and that
they are slender rods entirely separate from each
other in the long-tailed genera.</p>


<h4>THE TEETH</h4>

<p>The teeth are all of pointed, elongated shape, without
distinction into the kinds seen in most mammals
and named incisors, canines, and grinders. They are
organs for grasping, like the teeth of the fish-eating
Crocodile of India, and are not unlike the simple teeth
of some Porpoises. They are often implanted in
oblique oval sockets with raised borders, usually at
some distance apart from each other, and have the
crown pointed, flattened more on the outer side than
on the inner side, usually directed forward and curved
inward. As in many extinct animals allied to existing
reptiles, the teeth are reproduced by germs, which
originate on the inner side of the root and grow till
they gradually absorb the substance of the old tooth,
forming a new one in its place. Frequently in Solenhofen
genera, like Scaphognathus and Pterodactylus,
the successional tooth is seen in the jaw on the hinder
border of the tooth in use. There is some variation
in the character of bluntness or sharpness of the
crowns in the different genera, and in their size.</p>

<p>The name Dimorphodon, given to the animal from
the Lias of Lyme Regis, expresses the fact that the
teeth are of two kinds. In the front of the jaw three or
four large long teeth are found in the intermaxillary
bone on each side, as in some Plesiosaurs, while the
teeth found further back in the maxillary bone are
smaller, and directed more vertically downward. This
difference is more marked in the lower jaw than in the
upper jaw. In Rhamphorhynchus the teeth are all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
relatively long and large, and directed obliquely
forward, but absent from the extremities of the beak,
as in the German genus from the Lias named Dorygnathus,
in which the bone of the lower jaw (which
alone is known) terminates in a compressed spear.
In Scaphognathus the teeth are few, more vertical,
and do not extend backward so far as in Rhamphorhynchus,
but are carried forward to the extremity of
the blunt, deep jaw.</p>

<p>In the short-tailed Pterodactyles the teeth are
smaller, shorter, wider at the base of the crown,
closer together, and do not extend so far backward
in the jaw. In Ornithocheirus two teeth always
project forward from the front of the jaw. Ornithostoma
is toothless.</p>


<h4>SUPPOSED HORNY BEAK</h4>

<p>Sometimes a horny covering has been suggested
for the beak, like that seen in birds or turtles, but no
such structure has been preserved, even in the Solenhofen
Slate, in which such a structure would seem as
likely to be preserved as a wing membrane, though
there is one doubtful exception. There are marks of
fine blood vessels on some of the jaws, indicating a
tough covering to the bone. In Rhamphorhynchus
the jaws appear to gape towards their extremities as
though the interspace had originally been occupied
by organic substance like a horny beak.</p>


<h4>LOWER JAW</h4>

<p>The lower jaw varies in relative length with the
vertical or horizontal position of the quadrate bone in
the skull. In Dimorphodon the jaw is as long as the
skull; but in the genera from the Oolitic rocks the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
mandible is somewhat shorter, and in Ornithostoma
the discrepancy reaches its maximum. The hinder
part of the jaw is never prolonged backward much
beyond the articulation, differing in this respect from
Crocodiles and Plesiosaurs.</p>

<p>The depth of the jaw varies. It is slender in
Pterodactylus, and is probably stronger relatively to
the skull in Scaphognathus than in any other form.
It fits between the teeth and bones of the alveolar
border in the skull, in all the genera. In Dimorphodon
its hinder border is partly covered by the
descending edge of the malar process which these
animals develop in common with some Dinosaurs,
and some Anomodont reptiles, and many of the lower
mammals. In this hinder region the lower jaw is
sometimes perforated, in the same way as in Crocodiles.
That condition is observed in Dimorphodon,
but is not found in Pterodactylus. The lower jaw is
always composite, being formed by several bones, as
among reptiles and birds. The teeth are in the
dentary bone or bones, and these bones are almost
always blended as in most birds and Turtles, and not
separate from each other as among Crocodiles, Lizards,
and Serpents.</p>

<p>An interesting contour for the lower border of the
jaw is seen in Ornithostoma, as made known in
figures of American examples by Professors Marsh
and Williston. It deepens as it extends backwards
for two-thirds its length, stops at an angle, and then
the depth diminishes to the articulation with the
skull. This angle of the lower jaw is a characteristic
feature of the jaws of Mammals. It is seen in the
monotreme Echidna, and is characteristic of some
Theriodont Reptiles from South Africa, which in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
many ways resemble Mammals. The character is
not seen in the jaws of specimens from the Oolitic
rocks, but is developed in the toothed Ornithocheirus
from the Cambridge Greensand, and is absent from
the jaws of existing reptiles and birds.</p>

<h4>SUMMARY OF CHARACTERS OF THE HEAD</h4>

<p>Taken as a whole, the head differs from other types
of animals in a blending of characters which at the
present day are found among Birds and Reptiles, with
some structures which occur in extinct groups of
animals with similar affinities, and perhaps a slight
indication of features common to the lowest mammals.
It is chiefly upon the head that the diverse views of
earlier writers have been based.  Cuvier was impressed
with the reptilian aspect of the teeth; but in
later times discoveries were made of Birds with teeth&mdash;Arch&aelig;opteryx,
Ichthyornis, Hesperornis. The teeth
are quite reptilian, being not unlike miniature teeth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
of Mosasaurus.  If those birds had been found prior
to the discovery of Pterodactyles, the teeth might
have been regarded as a link with the more ancient
birds, rather than a crucial difference between birds
and reptiles.</p>

<p>All the specimens show a lateral temporal hole in
the bones behind the eye, and this is found in no
bird or mammal, and is typical of such reptiles as
Hatteria.  The quadrate bone may not be so decisive
as Cuvier thought it to be, for its form is not unlike
the quadrate of a bird, and different, so far as I have
seen, from that of living reptiles.  This region of the
head is reptilian, and if it occurred in a bird the character
would be as astonishing as was the discovery of
teeth in extinct birds.  These characters of the head
are also found in fossil animals named Dinosaurs, in
association with many resemblances to birds in their
bones.</p>

<p>The palate might conceivably be derived from
that of Hatteria by enlarging the small opening in
the middle line in that reptile till it extended forward
between the vomera; but it is more easily compared
with a bird, which the animal resembles in its beak,
and in the position of the nares.  Excepting certain
Lizards, all true existing Reptiles have the nostrils
far forward and bordered by two premaxillary bones
instead of one intermaxillary, as in Birds and Ornithosaurs.
If nothing were known of the animal but
its head bones, it would be placed between Reptiles
and Birds.</p>

THE BACKBONE, OR VERTEBRAL
COLUMN</h2>


<p>The backbone is a more deep-seated part of the
skeleton than the head. It is more protected
by its position, and has less varied functions to perform.
Therefore it varies less in distinctive character
within the limits of each of the classes of vertebrate
animals than either the head or limbs. It is divided
into neck bones, the cervical vertebr&aelig;; back bones,
the dorsal vertebr&aelig;; loin bones, the lumbar vertebr&aelig;;
the sacrum, or sacral vertebr&aelig;, which support the
hind limbs; and the tail. Of these parts the tail is
the least important, though it reaches a length in
existing reptiles which sometimes exceeds the whole
of the remainder of the body, and includes hundreds
of vertebr&aelig;. It attains its maximum among serpents
and lizards. In frogs it is practically absent. In
some of the higher mammals it is a rudiment, which
does not extend beyond the soft parts of the body.</p>


<h4>THE NECK</h4>

<p>The neck is more liable to vary than the back, with
the habit of life of the animal. And although
mammals almost always preserve the same number
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of seven bones in the neck, the bones vary in length
between the short condition of the porpoise, in
which the neck is almost lost, and the long bones
which form the neck of the Llama, though even these
may be exceeded by some fossil reptiles like Tanystroph&#339;us.
In many mammals the neck bones do
not differ in length or size from those of the back.
In others, like the Horse and Ox, they are much
broader and larger.</p>

<p>There is the same sort of variation in the bones of
the neck among birds, some being slender like the
Heron, others broad like the Swan.  But there is also
a singular variation in number of vertebral bones
in a bird's neck.  At fewest there are nine, which
equals the exceptionally large number found among
mammals in the neck of one of the Sloths.  Usually
birds have ten to fifteen cervical vertebr&aelig;, and in the
Swan there are twenty-three.  Most of the neck bones
of birds are relatively long, and the length of the neck
is often greater than the remainder of the vertebral
column.</p>

<p>Reptiles usually have short necks.  The common
Turtle has eight bones in the neck, ten in the back.
The two regions are sharply defined by the dorsal
shield.  Their articular ends are sometimes cupped in
front, in the neck, sometimes cupped behind, or convex
at both ends, or even flattened, or the articulation
may be made exceptionally by the neural arch alone.
Nine is the largest number of neck bones in existing
Lizards, and there are usually nine in Crocodiles; so
that reptiles closely approach mammals in number of
the neck bones.  It is remarkable that the maximum
number in a mammal and in living reptiles should
coincide with the minimum number in birds.  Therefore
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the number of cervical vertebr&aelig; as an attribute
of Mammal, Bird, or Reptile, can only be important
from its constancy.</p>

<p>German naturalists affirm on clear evidence that
the Solenhofen Pterodactyles have seven cervical vertebr&aelig;.
In many specimens there can be no doubt
about the number, because the neck bones are easily
distinguished from those of the back by their size;
but the number is not always easy to count.</p>

<p>As in Birds, the first vertebra, or atlas, in Pterodactyles
is extremely short, and is generally&mdash;if not
always&mdash;blended with the much longer second vertebra,
named the axis.  The front of the atlas forms
a small rounded cup to articulate with the rounded
ball of the basioccipital bone at the back of the skull.
The third and fourth vertebr&aelig; are longer, but the
length visibly shortens in the sixth and seventh.</p>

<p>Sometimes the vertebr&aelig; are slender and devoid of
strong spinous processes.  This is the condition in
the little <i>Pterodactylus longirostris</i> and in the comparatively
large <i>Cycnorhamphus Fraasii</i>, in which
there is a slight median ridge along the upper surface
of the arch of the vertebra. This condition is paralleled
in birds with long necks, especially wading
birds such as the Heron.  Other Ornithosaurs, such
as Ornithocheirus from the Cretaceous rocks, have the
neck much more massive.  The vertebr&aelig; are flattened
on the under side.  The arch above the nervous
matter of the spinal cord has a more or less considerable
transverse expansion, and may even be as
wide as long.  These vertebr&aelig; have proportions and
form such as may be seen in Vultures or in the
Swan.  In either case the form of the neck bones
is more or less bird-like, and the neural spine may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
be elevated, especially in Pterodactyles with long
tails.</p>

<p>One of the most distinctive features of the neck
bones of a bird is the way in which the cervical ribs
are blended with the vertebr&aelig;. They are small, and
each is often prolonged in a needle-like rod at the
side of the neck bone.</p>

<p>In Ornithocheirus the cervical rib similarly blends
with the vertebra by two articulations, as in mammals,
so that it might escape notice but for the
channel of a blood vessel which is thus inclosed.
In several of the older Pterodactyles from Solenhofen
the ribs of the neck vertebr&aelig; remain separated,
as in a Crocodile, though still bird-like in their
form, anterior position, and mode of attachment. In
Terrapins and Tortoises the long neck vertebr&aelig; have
no cervical ribs.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_24" id="Fig_24"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 24 &nbsp; UNITED ATLAS AND AXIS OF ORNITHOCHEIRUS</span>

<img src="images/i_098.jpg" width="640" height="337" alt="FIG. 24" title="FIG. 24" />
</div>

<p>The articular surfaces between the bodies of the
vertebr&aelig;, in the neck, are transversely oval. The middle
part of this articular joint is made by the body of
the vertebra; its outer parts are in the neural arch.
In front this surface is a hollow channel, often more
depressed than in any other animals. The corresponding
surface behind is convex, with a process on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
each side at its lower outer angles (<a href="#Fig_25">Fig. 25</a>). It is a
modification of the cup-and-ball form of vertebral
articulation, which at the present day is eminently
reptilian. Serpents and Crocodiles have the articulations
similarly vertical, but in both the form of the
articulation is a circle. In Lizards the articular cup is
usually rather wider than deep, when the cup and
ball are developed in the vertebr&aelig;; it differs from
the vertical condition in pterodactyles in being oblique
and much narrower from side to side. Only among
Crocodiles and Hatteria is there a double articulation
for the cervical rib, though in neither order have rib
or vertebra in the neck the bird-like proportions
which are usual in these animals. Pterodactyles show
no resemblance to birds in this vertebral articulation.
A Bird has the corresponding surface concave from
side to side in front, but it is also convex from above
downward, producing what is known as the saddle-shaped
form which is peculiarly avian, being found
in existing birds except in part of the back in Penguins.
It is faintly approximated to in one or two
neck vertebr&aelig; in man. Professor Williston remarks
that in the toothless Pterodactyles of Kansas the
hinder ball of the vertebral articulation is continued
downward and outward as a concave articulation
upon the processes at its outer corners. There are
no mammals with a cup-and-ball articulation between
the vertebr&aelig;, so that for what it is worth the character
now described in Ornithosaurs is reptilian, when
judged by comparison with existing animals.</p>

<p>Low down on each side of the vertebra, at the
junction of its body with the neural arch, is a large
ovate foramen, transversely elongated, and often a
little impressed at the border, which is the entrance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of the air cell into the bone. These foramina are
often one-third of the length of the neck vertebr&aelig;
in specimens from the Cambridge Greensand, where
the neck bones vary from three-quarters of an inch
to about two and a half inches in length, and in
extreme forms are as wide as long. The width of
the interspace between the foramina is one-half the
width of the vertebr&aelig;, though this character varies
with different genera and species. Several species
from the Solenhofen Slate have the neck long and
slender, on the type of the Flamingo. In others the
neck is thick and short&mdash;in the <i>Scaphognathus crassirostris</i>
and <i>Pterodactylus spectabilis</i>. Some genera
with slender necks have the bones preserved with a
curved contour, such as might suggest a neck carried
like that of a Llama or a Camel. The neck is occasionally
preserved in a curve like a capital <b>S</b>, as
though about to be darted forward like that of a
bird in the act of striking its prey. The genera of
Pterodactyles with short necks may have had as great
mobility of neck as is found among birds named
Ducks and Divers; but those Pterodactyles with
stout necks, such as Dimorphodon and Ornithocheirus,
in which the vertebr&aelig; are large, appear to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
have been built more for strength than activity, and
the neck bones have been chiefly concerned in the
muscular effort to use the fighting power of the jaws
in the best way.</p>

<h4>THE BACK</h4>

<p>The region of the back in a Pterodactyle is short
as compared with the neck, and relatively is never
longer than the corresponding region in a bird. The
shortness results partly from the short length of the
vertebr&aelig;, each of which is about as long as wide.
There is also a moderate number of bones in the
back. In most skeletons from Solenhofen these
vertebr&aelig; between the neck and girdle of hip bones
number from twelve to sixteen. They have a general
resemblance in form to the dorsal vertebr&aelig; in birds.
The greatest number of such vertebr&aelig; in birds is
eleven. The number is small because some of the
later vertebr&aelig; in birds are overlapped by the bones
of the hip girdle, which extend forward and cover
them at the sides, so that they become blended with
the sacrum. This region of the skeleton in the
Dimorphodon from the Lias is remarkable for the
length of the median process, named the neural
spine, which is prolonged upward like the spines of
the early dorsal vertebr&aelig; of Horses, Deer, and other
mammals. In this character they differ from living
reptiles, and parallel some Dinosaurs from the Weald.
The bones of the back in Ornithocheirus from the
Cambridge Greensand show the under side to be well
rounded, so that the articular surfaces between the
vertebr&aelig;, though still rather wider than deep, are
much less depressed than in the region of the neck.
The neural canal for the spinal cord has become
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
larger and higher, and the sides of the bone are
somewhat compressed. Strong transverse processes
for the support of the ribs are elevated above the
level of the neural canal, at the sides of vertebr&aelig;
compressed on the under sides, and directed outward.
Between these lateral horizontal platforms
is the compressed median neural spine, which varies
in vertical height. The articulation of the ribs is not
seen clearly. Isolated ribs from the Stonesfield Slate
have double-headed dorsal ribs, like those of birds.
In some specimens from the Solenhofen Slate like
the Scaphognathus, in the University Museum at
Bonn, dorsal ribs appear to be attached by a notch
in the transverse process of the dorsal vertebra, which
resembles the condition in Crocodiles. Variations in
the mode of attachment of ribs among mammals
may show that character to be of subordinate importance.
Von Meyer has described the first pair
of ribs as frequently larger than the others, and
there appear in Rhamphorhynchus to be examples
preserved of the sternal ribs, which connect the
dorsal ribs with the sternum. Six pairs have been
counted. A more interesting feature in the ribs
consists in the presence behind the sternum, which
is shorter than the corresponding bone in most birds,
of median sternal ribs. They are slender <b>V</b>-shaped
bones in the middle line of the abdomen, which
overlapped the ends of the dorsal ribs like the
similar sternal bones of reptiles. Such structures
are unknown among Birds and Mammals. There is
no trace in the dorsal ribs of the claw-like process,
which extends laterally from rib to rib as a marked
feature in many birds. Its presence or absence may
not be important, because it is represented by fibro-cartilage
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in the ribs of crocodiles, and may be a small
cartilage near the head of the rib in serpents, and is
only ossified in some ribs of the New Zealand reptile
Hatteria. So that it might have been present in a
fossil animal without being ossified and preserved.
Although the structure is associated with birds, it
is possibly also represented by the great bony plates
which cover the ribs in Chelonians, and combine to
form the shield which covers the turtle's back. The
structure is as characteristic of reptiles as of birds,
but is not necessarily associated with either.</p>

<p class="center">The upper figures show the side and back of a dorsal vertebra of

</div>

<p>There are two remarkable modifications of the
early dorsal vertebr&aelig; in some of the Cretaceous
Pterodactyles. First, in the genus Ornithodesmus
from the Weald the early dorsal vertebr&aelig; are blended
together into a continuous mass, like that which is
found in the corresponding region of the living
Frigate-bird, only more consolidated, and similar to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
that consolidated structure found behind the dorsal
vertebr&aelig;, known as the sacrum, made by the blending
of the vertebr&aelig; into a solid mass which supports
the hip bones. Secondly, in some of the Cretaceous
genera of Pterodactyles of Europe and America the
vertebr&aelig; in the front part of the back are similarly
blended, but their union is less complete; and in
genera Ornithocheirus and Ornithostoma&mdash;the former
chiefly English, the latter chiefly American&mdash;the
sides of the neural spines are flattened to form an
oval articular surface on each side, which gives
attachment to the flattened ends of their shoulder-blade
bones named the scapul&aelig;. This condition is
found in no other animals. Three vertebr&aelig; appear
to have their neural arches thus united together.
The structure so formed may be named the notarium
to distinguish it from the sacrum.</p>


<h4>SACRUM</h4>

<p>For some mysterious reason the part of the backbone
which lies between the bones of the hips and
supports them is termed the sacrum. Among living
reptiles the number of vertebr&aelig; in this region is
usually two, as in lizards and crocodiles. There are
other groups of fossil reptiles in which the number
of sacral vertebr&aelig; is in some cases less and in other
cases more. There is, perhaps, no group in which the
sacrum makes a nearer approach to that of birds
than is found among these Pterodactyles, although
there are more sacral vertebr&aelig; in some Dinosaurs.
In birds the sacral vertebr&aelig; number from five to
twenty-two. In bats the number is from five to six.
In some Solenhofen species, such as <i>Pterodactylus
dubius</i> and <i>P. Kochi</i> and <i>P. grandipelvis</i>, the number
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
is usually five or six. The vertebr&aelig; are completely
blended. The pneumatic foramina in the sacrum, so
far as they have been observed, are on the under
sides of the transverse processes;
while in the corresponding notarial
structure in the shoulder
girdle the foramina are in front
of the transverse processes. Almost
any placental mammal in
which the vertebr&aelig; of the sacral
region are anchylosed together
has a similar sacrum, which
differs from that of birds in the
more complete individuality of
the constituent bones remaining
evident. The transverse processes
in front of the sacrum are
wider than in its hinder part; so
that the pelvic bones which are
attached to it converge as they
extend backward, as among
mammals. The bodies of the vertebr&aelig; forming the
sacrum are similar in length to those of the back.
Each transverse process is given off opposite the
body of its own vertebra, but from a lower lateral
position than in the region of the back, in which the
vertebr&aelig; are free.</p>

<p class="center">Showing the complete blending
of the vertebr&aelig; and ribs as
in a bird, with the well-defined
Iliac bones, produced chiefly
in front of the acetabulum for
the head of the femur.</p>
</div>


<p>The hip bones are closely united with the sacrum
by bony union, and rarely appear to come away from
the sacral vertebr&aelig;, as among mammals and reptiles,
though this happens with the Lias Pterodactyles. In
the Stonesfield Slate and Solenhofen Slate the slender
transverse processes from the vertebr&aelig; blend with the
ilium of the hip girdle, and form a series of transverse
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
foramina on each side of the bodies of the vertebr&aelig;.
In the Cambridge Greensand genera the part
of the ilium above the acetabulum for the articular
head of the femur appears to be always broken away,
so that the relation of the sacrum to the pelvis has
not been observed. This character is no mark of
affinity, but only shows that ossification obliterated
sutures among these animals in the same way as
among birds.</p>

<p>The great difference between the sacrum of a
Pterodactyle and that of a bird has been rendered
intelligible by the excellent discussion of the sacral
region in birds made by Professor Huxley. He
showed that it is only the middle part of the sacrum
of a chicken which corresponds to the true sacrum of
a reptile, and comprises the five shortest of the vertebr&aelig;;
while the four in front correspond to those of
the lower part of the back, which either bear no ribs
or very short ribs, and are known as the lumbar
region in mammals, so that the lower part of the
back becomes blended with the sacrum, and thus
reduces the number of dorsal vertebr&aelig;. Similarly
the five vertebr&aelig; which follow the true sacral vertebr&aelig;
are originally part of the tail, and have been
blended with the other vertebr&aelig; in front, in consequence
of the extension along them of the bird's
hip bones. This interpretation helps to account for
the great length of the sacrum in many birds, and
also explains in part the singular shortness of the
tail in existing birds. The Ornithosaur sacrum has
neither the lumbar nor the caudal portions of the
sacrum of a bird.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE TAIL</h4>

<p>The tail is perhaps the least important part of the
skeleton, since it varies in character and length in
different genera. The short tails seen in typical
pterodactyles include as few as ten vertebr&aelig; in
<i>Pterodactylus grandipelvis</i> and <i>P. Kochi</i>, and as many
as fifteen vertebr&aelig; in <i>Pterodactylus longirostris</i>. The
tails are more like those of mammals than existing
birds, in which there are usually from six to ten
vertebr&aelig; terminating in the ploughshare bone. But
just as some fossil birds, like the Arch&aelig;opteryx, have
about twenty long and slender vertebr&aelig; in the tail,
so in the pterodactyle Rhamphorhynchus this region
becomes greatly extended, and includes from thirty-eight
to forty vertebr&aelig;. In Dimorphodon the tail
vertebr&aelig; are slightly fewer. The earliest are very
short, and then they become elongated to two or
three times the length of the early tail vertebr&aelig;, and
finally shorten again towards the extremity of the
tail, where the bones are very slender. In all long-tailed
Ornithosaurians the vertebr&aelig; are supported
and bordered by slender ossified ligaments, which
extend like threads down the tail, just as they do
in Rats and many other mammals and in some
lizards.</p>

<p>Professor Marsh was able to show that the extremity
of the tail in Rhamphorhynchus sometimes
expands into a strong terminal caudal membrane of
four-sided somewhat rhomboidal shape. He regards
this membrane as having been placed vertically. It
is supported by delicate processes which represent
the neural spines of the vertebr&aelig; prolonged upward.
They are about fifteen in number. A corresponding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
series of spines on the lower border, termed chevron
bones, equally long, were given off from the junctions
of the vertebr&aelig; on their under sides, and produced
downward. This vertical appendage is of some
interest because its expansion is like the tail of a
fish. It suggests the possibility of having been used
in a similar way to the caudal fin as an organ for
locomotion in water, though it is possible that it may
have also formed an organ used in flight for steering
in the air.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_28" id="Fig_28"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 28. &nbsp; EXTREMITY OF THE TAIL OF

<p class="center">Showing the processes on the upper and under sides of the vertebr&aelig;
which make the terminal leaf-like expansion</p>
</div>


<p>The tail vertebr&aelig; from the Cambridge Greensand
are mostly found isolated or with not more than four
joints in association. They are very like the slender
type of neck vertebr&aelig; seen in long-necked pterodactyles,
but are depressed, and though somewhat
wider are not unlike the tail vertebr&aelig; of the Rhamphorhynchus.
The pneumatic foramen in them is a
mere puncture. They have no transverse processes
or neural spines, nor indications of ribs, or chevron
bones.</p>

<p>The hindermost specimens of tail vertebr&aelig; observed
have the neural arch preserved to the end, as among
reptiles; whereas in mammals this arch becomes
lost towards the end of the tail. The processes
by which the vertebr&aelig; are yoked together are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
small. There is nothing to suggest that the tail was
long, except the circumstance that the slender caudal
vertebr&aelig; are almost as long as the stout cervical
vertebr&aelig; in the same animal. No small caudal
vertebr&aelig; have ever been found in the Cambridge
Greensand. The tail is very short, according to
Professor Williston, in the toothless Ornithostoma
in the Chalk of Kansas.</p>

THE HIP-GIRDLE AND HIND
LIMB</h2>


<p>The bones of the hip-girdle form a basin which
incloses and protects the abdominal vital organs.
It consists on each side of a composite bone, the
unnamed bones&mdash;<i>ossa innominata</i> of the older anatomists&mdash;which
are each attached to the sacrum on
their inner side, and on the outer side give attachment
to the hind limbs. As a rule three bones enter
into the borders of this cup, termed the acetabulum, in
which the head of the thigh bone, named the Femur,
moves with a more or less rotary motion.</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions in this division of the
cup between three bones, chiefly among Salamanders
and certain Frogs. In Crocodiles the bone below the
acetabular cup is not divided into two parts. And
in certain Plesiosaurs from the Oxford Clay&mdash;Mur&aelig;nosaurus&mdash;the
actual articulation appears to be made
by two bones&mdash;the ilium and ischium. The three
bones which form each side of the pelvis are known
as the ilium, or hip bone, sometimes termed the aitch
bone; secondly, the ischium, or sitz bone, being the
bone by which the body is supported in a sitting
position; and thirdly the pubis, which is the bone in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
front of the acetabulum. The pubic bones meet in
the middle line of the body on the under side of the
pelvis in man, and on each side are partly separated
from the ischia by a foramen, spoken of as the
obturator foramen, which in Pterodactyles is minute
and almost invisible, when it exists.</p>

<p>There is often a fourth bony element in the pelvis.
In some Salamanders a single cartilage is directed
forward, and forked in front. According to Professor
Huxley something of this kind is seen in the Dog.
The pair of bones which extend forward in front
of the pelvis in Crocodiles may be of the same kind,
in which case they should be called prepubic bones.
But among the lower mammals named marsupials
a pouch is developed for the protection of the young
and supported by two slender bones attached to the
pubes, and these bones have long been known as
marsupial bones. In a still lower group of mammalia
named monotremata, which lay eggs, and in many
ways approximate to reptiles and birds, stronger
bones are developed on the front edge of the pubes,
and termed prepubic bones. They do not support a
marsupium.</p>

<p>Naturalists have been uncertain as to the number
of bones in the pelvis of Pterodactyles, because the
bones blend together early in life, as in birds. Some
follow the Amphibian nomenclature, and unite the
ischium and pubis into one bone, which is then
termed ischium, when the prepubis is termed the
pubis, and regarded as removed from the acetabulum.
There is no ground for this interpretation, for the
sutures are clear between the three pelvic bones in
the acetabulum in some specimens, like <i>Cycnorhamphus
Fraasii</i>, from Solenhofen, and some examples
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
of Ornithocheirus from the Cambridge Greensand.
Pterodactyles all have prepubic bones, which are
only known in Ornithorhynchus and Echidna among
mammals, and are absent from the higher mammals
and birds. They are unknown in any other existing
animals, unless present in Crocodiles, in which ischium
and pubis are always undivided. Therefore it is
interesting to examine the characters of the Ornithosaurian
pelvis.</p>

<p>The acetabulum for the head of the femur is imperforate,
being a simple oval basin, as in Chelonian
reptiles and the higher Mammals. It never shows
the mark of the ligamentous attachment to the head
of the femur, which is seen in Mammals. In Birds
the acetabulum is perforated, as in many of the fossils
named Dinosaurs, and in Monotremata.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_29" id="Fig_29"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 29. &nbsp; COMPARISON OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE
PELVIS IN A BIRD AND A PTERODACTYLE</span>
<img src="images/i_112.jpg" width="640" height="259" alt="FIG. 29." title="FIG. 29." />
</div>


<p>Secondly, the ilium is elongated, and extends quite
as much in front of the acetabulum as behind it.
The bone is not very deep in this front process.
Among existing animals this relation of the bone is
nearer to birds than to any other type, since birds
alone have the ilium extended from the acetabulum
in both directions. The form of the Pterodactyle
ilium is usually that of the embryo bird, and its
slender processes compare in relative length better
with those of the unhatched fowl and Apteryx of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
New Zealand than with the plate-like form in adult
birds.</p>

<p>In mammals the ilium is directed forward, and
even in the Cape ant-eater Orycteropus there is only
an inappreciable production of the bone backward
behind the acetabulum. Among reptiles the general
position of the acetabulum is at the forward termination
of the ilium, though the Crocodile has some
extension of the bone in both directions, without
forming distinct anterior and posterior processes.
This anterior and posterior extension of the ilium
is seen in the Theriodont reptiles of Russia and of
South Africa, as well as in Dinosaurs.</p>

<img src="images/i_113.jpg" width="640" height="195" alt="FIG. 30." title="FIG. 30." />
</div>

<p>Thirdly, in all pterodactyles the ischium and pubis
are more or less completely blended into a sheet of
bone, unbroken by perforation, though there is usually
a minute vascular foramen; or the lower border may
be notched between the ischium and the pubis, as
in some of the Solenhofen species, and the pubis
does not reach the median line of the body. But
in Dimorphodon the pelvic sheet of bone is unbroken
by any notch or perforation. The notch between
the ischium and pubis is well marked in <i>Pterodactylus
longirostris</i>, and better marked in <i>Pterodactylus dubius</i>,
<i>Cycnorhamphus Fraasii</i>, and Rhamphorhynchus. The
fossil animals which appear to come nearest to the
Pterodactyles in the structure of the pelvis are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Theriodonts from the Permian rocks of Russia. The
type known as Rhopalodon has the ilium less prolonged
front and back, and is much deeper than in any
Pterodactyle; but the acetabulum is imperforate, and
the ischium and pubis are not always completely
separated from each other by suture. In the pelvis
referred to the Theriodont Deuterosaurus there is
some approximation to the pelvis of Rhamphorhynchus
and of <i>Pterodactylus dubius</i> in the depth
of the division between the pubis and ischium.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_31" id="Fig_31"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 31 &nbsp; PELVIS AND PREPUBIC BONES OF RHAMPHORHYNCHUS</span>
<img src="images/i_114.jpg" width="640" height="240" alt="FIG. 31" title="FIG. 31" />
<p class="center">On the left-hand side the two prepubic bones are separate. On
the right-hand they are united into a transverse bar which
overlaps the front of pelvis seen from the under side</p>
</div>


<p>There are three modifications of the Ornithosaurian
pelvis. First, the type of Rhamphorhynchus,
in which the pubis and ischium are inclined somewhat
backward, and in which the two prepubic bones
are triangular, and are often united together to form
a transverse bow in front of the pubic region.</p>

<p>Secondly, there is the ordinary form of pelvis in
which the pubis and ischium usually unite with each
other down their length, as in Dimorphodon, but
sometimes, as in <i>Pterodactylus dubius</i>, divide immediately
below the acetabulum. All these types
possess the paddle-shaped prepubic bones, which are
never united in the median line.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is the cretaceous form indicated by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Ornithocheirus and Ornithostoma, in which the
posterior half of the ilium is modified in a singular
way, since it is more elevated towards the sacrum
than the anterior half, suggesting the contour of the
upper border of the ilium in a lizard. Without being
reptilian&mdash;the anterior prolongation of the bone
makes that impossible&mdash;it suggests the lizards. This
type also possesses prepubic bones. They appear,
according to Professor Williston, to be more like
the paddle-shaped bones of Pterodactylus than like
the angular bones in Rhamphorhynchus. The prepubic
bones are united in the median line as in
Rhamphorhynchus. But their median union in that
genus favours the conclusion that the bones were
united in the median line in all species, though they
are only co-ossified in these two families.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_32" id="Fig_32"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 32. &nbsp;  THE PELVIC BONES OF AN ALLIGATOR SEEN FROM BELOW</span>
<img src="images/i_115.jpg" width="640" height="403" alt="FIG. 32." title="FIG. 32." />
<p class="center">The bones in front are here regarded as prepubic, but are commonly
named pubic</p>
</div>


<p>This median union of the prepubic bones is a
difference from those mammals like the Ornithorhynchus
and Echidna, which approach nearest to
the Reptilia. In them the prepubic bones have a long
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
attachment to the front margin of the pubis, and
extend their points forward without any tendency
for the anterior extremities to approximate or unite.
The marsupial mammals have the same character,
keeping the marsupial bones completely distinct
from each other at their free extremities. The
only existing animals in which an approximation
is found to the prepubic bones in Pterodactyles
are Crocodiles, in bones which most writers term the
pubic bones. This resemblance, without showing
any strong affinity with the Crocodilia, indicates
that Crocodiles have more in common with the
fossil flying animals than any other group of existing
reptiles; for other reptiles all want prepubic bones,
or bones in front of the pubic region.</p>


<h4>THE HIND LIMB</h4>

<p>The hind limb is exceptionally long in proportion
to the back. This is conspicuous in the skeletons of
the short-tailed Pterodactyles, and is also seen in
Dimorphodon. In Rhamphorhynchus the hind limb
is relatively much shorter, so that the animal, when
on all fours, may have had an appearance not unlike
a Bat in similar position. The limb is exceptionally
short in the little <i>Ptenodracon brevirostris</i>. The
bones of the hind limb are exceptionally interesting.
One remarkable feature common to all the specimens
is the great elongation of the shin bones relatively to
the thigh bones. The femur is sometimes little more
than half the length of the tibia, and always shorter
than that bone. The proportions are those of
mammals and birds. Some mammals have the leg
shorter than the thigh, but mammals and birds
alone, among existing animals, have the proportions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
which characterise Pterodactyles. The foot appears
to have been applied to the ground not always as in
a bird, but more often in the manner of reptiles, or
mammals in which the digits terminate in claws.</p>


<h4>THE FEMUR</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_33" id="Fig_33"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 33. &nbsp;  THE FEMUR</span>
<img src="images/i_117.jpg" width="640" height="345" alt="FIG. 33." title="FIG. 33." />
<p class="center">On the right is a front view of femur of a bear. In the middle are front and
side views of the femur of Ornithocheirus. On the left is the femur
of Echidna. These comparisons illustrate the mammalian
characters of the Pterodactyle thigh bone</p>
</div>


<p>The thigh bone, on account of the small size of
many of the specimens, is not always quite clear
evidence as an indication of technical resemblance to
other animals. The bone is always a little curved,
has always a rounded, articular head, and rounded
distal condyles. Its most remarkable features are
shown in the large, well-preserved specimens from
the Cambridge Greensand. The rounded, articular
head is associated with a constricted neck to the
bone, followed by a comparatively straight shaft with
distal condyles, less thickened than in mammals. No
bird is known, much less any reptile, with a femur
like Ornithocheirus. Only among Mammals is a
similar bone known with a distinct neck; and only
a few mammals have the exceptional characters of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the rounded head and constricted neck at all
similar to the Cretaceous Pterodactyles. A few
types, such as the higher apes, the Hyrax, and
animals especially active in the hind limb, have a
femur at all resembling the Pterodactyle in the pit
for the obturator externus muscle, behind the trochanter
major, such as is seen in a small femur from
Ashwell. The femur varies in different genera, so as
to suggest a number of mammalia rather than any
particular animal for comparison. These approximations
may be consequences of the ways in which
the bones are used. When functional modifications
of the skeleton are developed, so as to produce
similar forms of bones, the muscles to which they
give attachment, which act upon the bones, and
determine their growth, are substantially the same.
In the <i>Pterodactylus longirostris</i> the femur corresponds
in length to about eleven dorsal vertebr&aelig;.
The end next the shin bone is less expanded than
is usual among Mammals, and rather suggests an
approach to the condition in Crocodiles, in the moderate
thickness and breadth of the articular end, and
the slight development of the terminal pulley-joint.
One striking feature of the femur is the circumstance
that the articular head, as compared with the distal
end, is directed forward and very slightly inward and
upward. So that allowing for the outward divergence
of the pelvic bones, as they extend forward, there
must have been a tendency to a knock-kneed approximation
of the lower ends of the thigh bones,
as in Mammals and Birds, rather than the outward
divergence seen in Reptiles.</p>

<p>Apparently the swing of the leg and foot, as it
hung on the distal end of the femur, must have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
tended rather to an inward than to an outward
direction, so that the feet might be put down upon
the same straight line; this arrangement suggests
rapid movement.</p>


<h4>TIBIA AND FIBULA</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 512px;">
<a name="Fig_34" id="Fig_34"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 34. &nbsp;  COMPARISON OF THE TIBIA AND FIBULA
IN ORNITHOSAUR AND VULTURE</span>
<img src="images/i_119.jpg" width="512" height="480" alt="FIG. 34." title="FIG. 34." />
</div>


<p>In <i>Pterodactylus longirostris</i> the tibia is slender,
more than a fifth longer than the femur. A crest is
never developed at the proximal end, like that seen
in the Guillemot and Diver and other water birds.
The bone is of comparatively uniform thickness down
the shaft in most of the Solenhofen specimens, as in
most birds. At the distal end the shin bone commonly
has a rounded, articular termination, like that
seen in birds. This is conspicuous in the <i>Pterodactylus
grandis</i>. In other specimens the tarsal bones,
which form this pulley, remain distinct from the tibia;
and the upper row of these bones appears to consist
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of two bones, like those which in many Dinosaurs
combine to form the pulley-like end of the tibia
which represents the bird's drum-stick bone. They
correspond with the ankle bones in man named
astragalus and os calcis.</p>

<p>Complete English specimens of tibia and fibula are
found in the genus Dimorphodon from the Lias, in
which the terminal pulley of the distal end has some
expansion, and is placed forward towards the front of
the tibia, as in some birds. The rounded surface of
the pulley is rather better marked than in birds.
The proximal end of the shaft is relatively stout, and
is modified by the well-developed fibula, which is a
short external splint bone limited to the upper half
of the tibia, as in birds; but contributing with it to
form the articular surface for the support of the
lower end of the femur, taking a larger share in that
work than in birds. Frequently there is no trace of
the fibula visible in Solenhofen specimens as preserved;
or it is extremely slender and bird-like, as in
<i>Pterodactylus longirostris</i>. In Rhamphorhynchus it
appears to extend the entire length of the tibia, as in
Dinosaurs. In the specimens from the Cambridge
Greensand there is indication of a small proximal crest
to the tibia with a slight ridge, but no evidence that
this is due to a separate ossification. The patella, or
knee-cap, is not recognised in any fossil of the group.
There is no indication of a fibula in the specimens
thus far known from the Chalk rocks either of Kansas
in America, or in England.</p>

<p>The region of the tarsus varies from the circumstance
that in many specimens the tibia terminates
downward in a rounded pulley, like the drum-stick of
a bird; while in other specimens this union of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
proximal row of the tarsal bones with the tibia does
not take place, and then there are two rows of
separate tarsal bones, usually with two bones in each
row. When the upper row is united with the tibia
the lower row remains distinct from the metatarsus,
though no one has examined these separate tarsal
bones so as to define them.</p>


<h4>THE FOOT</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_35" id="Fig_35"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 35. &nbsp;  METATARSUS AND DIGITS IN THREE TYPES
OF ORNITHOSAURS</span>
<img src="images/i_121.jpg" width="640" height="393" alt="FIG. 35." title="FIG. 35." />
</div>

<p>The foot sometimes has four toes, and sometimes
five. There are four somewhat elongated, slender
metatarsal bones, which are separate from each other
and never blended together, as in birds. There has
been a suspicion that the metatarsal bones were
separate in the young Arch&aelig;opteryx. In the young
of many birds the row of tarsal bones at the proximal
end of the metatarsus comes away, and there is a
partial division between the metatarsal bones, though
they remain united in the middle. And among Penguins,
in which the foot bones are applied to the
ground instead of being carried in the erect position
of ordinary birds, there is always a partial separation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
between the metatarsal bones, though they become
blended together. The Pterodactyle is therefore
different from birds in preserving the bones distinct
through life, and this character is more like Reptiles
than Mammals. The individual bones are not
like those of Dinosaurs, and diverge in Rhamphorhynchus
as though the animals were web-footed.
There is commonly a rudimentary fifth metatarsal.
It is sometimes only a claw-shaped appendage, like
that seen in the Crocodile. It is sometimes a short
bone, completely formed, and carrying two phalanges
in Solenhofen specimens: though no trace of these
phalanges is seen in the large toothless Pterodactyles
from the Cretaceous rocks of North America. In the
<i>Pterodactylus longirostris</i> the number of foot bones
on the ordinary digits is two, three, four, five, as in
lizards; but the short fifth metatarsal has only two
toe bones. In Dimorphodon the fifth digit was bent
upward, and supported a membrane for flight. There
are slight variations in the number of foot bones.
In the species <i>Pterodactylus scolopaciceps</i> the number
of bones in the toes follows the formula two, three,
three, four. In <i>Pterodactylus micronyx</i> the number is
two, three, three, three. The terminal claws are much
less developed than is usual with Birds; and there is
a difference from Bats in the unequal length of the
digits. Taken as a whole, the foot is perhaps more
reptilian than avian, and in some genera is crocodilian.</p>

<p>The foot is the light foot of an active animal. Von
Meyer thought that the hind legs were too slender
to enable the animal to walk on land; and Professor
Williston, of the University of Kansas, remarks that
the rudimentary claws and weak toes indicate that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
the animal could not have used the feet effectively
for grasping, while the exceedingly free movement
of the femur indicates great freedom of movement of
the hind legs; and he concludes that the function
of the legs was chiefly for guidance in flight through
their control over the movements, and expresses his
belief that the animal could not have stood upon the
ground with its feet. There may be evidence to
sustain other views. If the limb bones are reconstructed,
they form limbs not wanting in elegance
or length. If it is true, as Professor Williston suggests,
that the weight of his largest animals with the
head three feet long, and a stretch of wing of eighteen
or nineteen feet, did not exceed twenty pounds, there
can be no objection to regarding these animals as
quadrupeds, or even as bipeds, on the ground of the
limbs lacking the strength necessary to support the
body. The slender toes of many birds, and even the
two toes of the ostrich, may be thought to give less
adequate support for those animals than the metatarsals
and digits of Pterodactyles.</p>

SHOULDER-GIRDLE AND
FORE LIMB</h2>


<h4>STERNUM</h4>

<p>The sternum is always a distinguishing part of
the bony structure of the breast. In Crocodiles
it is a cartilage to which the sternal ribs unite; and
upon its front portion a flat knife-like bone called
the interclavicle is placed. In lizards like the Chameleon,
it is a lozenge-shaped structure of thin bony
texture, also bearing a long interclavicle, which supports
the clavicular bones, named collar bones in
man, which extend outward to the shoulder blades.
Among mammals the sternum is usually narrow and
flat, and often consists of many successive pieces in
the middle line, on the under side of the body.
Among Bats the anterior part is somewhat widened
from side to side, to give attachment to the collar
bones, but the sternum still remains a narrow bone,
much narrower than in Dolphins, and not differing
in character from many other Mammals, notwithstanding
the Bat's power of flight. The bone develops
a median keel for the attachment of the
muscles of the breast, but something similar is seen
in burrowing Insectivorous mammals like the Moles.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
So that, as Von Meyer remarked, the presence of a
keel on the sternum is not in itself sufficient evidence
to prove flight.</p>

<p>Among birds the sternum is greatly developed.
Broad and short in the Ostrich tribe, it is devoid of
a keel; and therefore the keel, if present in a bird,
is suggestive of flight. The keel is differently developed
according to the mode of attachment of the
several pectoral muscles which cover a bird's breast.
In several water birds the keel is strongly developed
in front, and dies away towards the hinder part of
the sternum, as in the Cormorant and its allies. The
sternum in German Pterodactyles is most nearly
comparable to these birds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_36" id="Fig_36"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 36. &nbsp; COMPARISON OF THE STERNUM</span>
<img src="images/i_125.jpg" width="640" height="376" alt="FIG. 36." title="FIG. 36." />
</div>

<p>In the Solenhofen Slate the sternum is fairly well
preserved in many Ornithosaurs. It is relatively
shorter than in birds, and is broader than long; but
not very like the sternum of reptile or mammal in
form. The keel is limited to the anterior part of the
shield of the sternum, as in Merganser and the Cormorant,
and is prolonged forward for some distance in
advance of it. Von Meyer noticed the resemblance of
this anterior process to the interclavicle of the Croco<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>dile
in position; but it is more like the keel of a bird's
sternum, and is not a separate bone as in Reptiles.
In Pterodactyles from the Cretaceous rocks, the side
bones, called coracoids, are articulated to saddle-shaped
surfaces at the hinder part of the base of
this keel, which are parallel in Ornithocheirus, as in
most birds, but overlap in Ornithodesmus, as in
Herons and wading birds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 484px;">

<p class="center">Showing the strong keel and the facets for the coracoid bones on its hinder
border above the lateral constrictions</p>
</div>

<p>The keel was pneumatic, and when broken is seen
to be hollow, and appears to have been exceptionally
high in Rhamphorhynchus, a genus in which the
wing bones are greatly elongated. Von Meyer found
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
in Rhamphorhynchus on each side of the sternum a
separate lateral plate with six pairs of sternal ribs,
which unite the sternum with the dorsal ribs, as in
the young of some birds. The hinder surface of the
sternum is imperfectly preserved in the toothless
Pterodactyles of Kansas. Professor Williston states
that the bone is extremely thin and pentagonal in
outline, projecting in front of the coracoids, in a
stout, blunt, keel-like process, similar to that seen in
the Pterodactyles of the Cambridge Greensand.
American specimens have not the same notch behind
the articulation for the coracoid to separate it
from the transverse lateral expansion of the sternal
shield. The lateral margin in the Cambridge Greensand
specimens figured by Professor Owen and myself
is broken; but Professor Williston had the good
fortune to find on the margin of the sternum the
articular surfaces which gave attachment to the sternal
ribs. The margin of the sternal bone thickens at these
facets, four of which are preserved. The sternum in
Ornithostoma was about four and a half inches long
by less than five and a half inches wide. The median
keel extends forward for rather less than two inches,
while in the smaller Cambridge species of Ornithocheirus
it extends forward for less than an inch and
a half.</p>

<p>A sternum of this kind is unlike that of any other
animal, but has most in common with a bird; and
may be regarded as indicating considerable power
of flight. The bone cannot be entirely attributed to
the effect of flight, since there is no such expanded
sternal shield in Bats. The small number of sternal
ribs is even more characteristic of birds than mammals
or reptiles.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE SHOULDER-GIRDLE</h4>

<p>The bones which support the fore limb are one
of the distinctive regions of the skeleton defining
the animal's place in nature. Among most of the
lower vertebrata, such as Amphibians and Reptiles,
the girdle is a double arch&mdash;the arch of the
collar bone or clavicles in front, and the arch of the
shoulder-blade or scapula behind. The clavicular
arch, when it exists, is formed of three or five parts&mdash;a
medium bar named the interclavicle, external to
which is a pair of bones called clavicles, reaching to
the front of the scapul&aelig; when they are present; and
occasionally there is a second pair of bones called
supraclavicles, extending from the clavicles up the
front margins of the scapul&aelig;. Thus the clavicular
arch is placed in front of the scapular arch. The
supraclavicles are absent from all living Reptiles, and
the clavicles are absent from Crocodiles. The interclavicle
is absent from all mammals except Echidna
and Ornithorhynchus. Clavicles also may be absent
in some orders of mammals. Hence the clavicular
arch may be lost, though the collar bones are retained
in man.</p>

<p>The scapular arch also is more complicated and
more important in the lower than in the higher
vertebrata. It may include three bones on each side
named coracoid, precoracoid, and scapula. But in
most vertebrates the coracoid and precoracoid appear
never to have been segmented so as to be separated
from each other; and it is only among extinct types
of reptiles, which appear to approximate to the Monotreme
mammals, that separate precoracoid bones are
found; though among most mammals, probably,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
there are stages of early development in which precoracoids
are represented by small cartilages, though
few mammals except Edentata like the Sloths and
Ant-eaters, retain even the coracoids as distinct bones.
Therefore, excepting the Edentata and the Monotremes,
the distinctive feature of the mammalian
shoulder-girdle appears to be that the limbs are supported
by the shoulder-blades, termed the scapul&aelig;.</p>

<p>Among reptiles there are several distinct types
of shoulder-girdle. Chelonians possess a pair of
bones termed coracoids which have no connexion
with a sternum; and their scapul&aelig; are formed of two
widely divergent bars, divided by a deeper notch than
is found in any fossil reptiles. Among Lizards both
scapula and coracoid are widely expanded, and the
coracoid is always attached to the sternum. Chameleons
have the blade of the scapula long and slender,
but the coracoid is always as broad as it is long.
Crocodiles have the bone more elongated, so that it
has somewhat the aspect of a very strong first sternal
rib when seen on the ventral face of the animal. The
bone is perforated by a foramen, which would probably
lie in the line of separation from the precoracoid
if any such separation had ever taken place. The
scapula, or shoulder-blade, of Crocodiles is a similar
flat bone, very much shorter than the scapula of a
Chameleon, and more like that of the New Zealand
Hatteria. Thus there is very little in common between
the several reptilian types of shoulder-girdle.</p>

<p>In birds the apparatus for the support of the wings
has a far-off resemblance to the Crocodilian type.
The coracoid bones, instead of being directed laterally
outward and upward from the sternum, as among
Crocodiles, are directed forward, so as to prolong the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
line of the breast bone, named the sternum. The
bird's coracoid is sometimes flattened towards the
breast bone among Swans and other birds; yet as a
rule the coracoid is a slender bar, which combines
with the still more slender and delicate blade of the
scapula, which rests on the ribs, to make the articulation
for the upper arm bone. Among reptiles the
scapula and coracoid are more or less in the same
straight line, as in the Ostrich, but in birds of flight
they meet at an angle which is less than a right angle,
and where they come in contact the external surface
is thickened and excavated to make the articulation
for the head of the humerus. There is nothing like
this shoulder-girdle outside the class of birds, until it
is compared with the corresponding structure in these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
extinct animals called Pterodactyles. The resemblance
between the two is surprising. It is not
merely the identity of form in the coracoid bone and
the scapula, but the similar angle at which they meet
and the similar position of the articulation for the
humerus. Everything in the Pterodactyle's shoulder-girdle
is bird-like, except the absence of the representative
of the clavicles, that forked <b>V</b>-shaped bone
of the bird which in scientific language is known as
the furculum, and is popularly termed the "merry-thought."
This kind of shoulder-girdle is found in
the genera from the Lias and the Oolitic rocks, both
of this country and Germany.</p>

THREE PTERODACTYLES AND A BIRD</span>

</div>




<p>In the Cretaceous rocks the scapula presents, in
most cases, a different appearance. The coracoid is
an elongated, somewhat triangular bone, compressed
on the outer margin as in birds, but differing alike
from birds and other Pterodactyles in not being
prolonged forward beyond the articulation for the
humerus. In these Cretaceous genera, toothed and
toothless alike, the articulation for the upper arm
bone truncates the extremity of the coracoid, so that
the bone is less like that of a bird in this feature.
Perhaps it shows a modification towards the crocodilian
direction. The scapula, which unites with the
coracoid at about a right angle, is similarly truncated
by the articular surface for the humerus; but the
bone is somewhat expanded immediately beyond the
articulation, and compressed; and instead of being
directed backward, it is directed inward over the ribs
to articulate with the neural arches of the early
dorsal vertebr&aelig; in the genera found in strata associated
with the Chalk. As the bone approaches
this articulation, it thickens and widens a little,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
becoming suddenly truncated by an ovate facet,
which exactly corresponds to the transversely ovate
impression, concave from front to back, which is seen
in the neural arches of the dorsal vertebr&aelig; on which
it fits. This condition is not present in all Cretaceous
Pterodactyles. It does not occur in the Kansas fossil,
named by Professor Marsh, Nyctodactylus. And it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
appears to be absent from the Pterodactyles of the
English Weald, named Ornithodesmus.</p>

<p class="center">Showing how the scapul&aelig; articulate with a vertebra and the articulation

the coracoid is unlike the condition shown in other Ornithosaurs</p>
</div>


<p>There is no approach to this transverse position of
the scapul&aelig; among birds. And while the form of
the bones in the older genera of Ornithosaurs is
singularly bird-like, the angular arrangement in this
Cretaceous genus is obtained by closely approximating
the articulations on the sternum, so that the
coracoids extend outward as in reptiles, instead of
forward as in birds; and the extremities of the
scapul&aelig; similarly approximate towards each other.
This rather recalls the relative positions of scapula
and coracoid among crocodiles. If crocodile and
bird had been primitive types of animals instead of
surviving types, it might almost seem as though
there had been a cunning and harmonious blending
of one with the other in evolving this form of
shoulder-girdle.</p>


<h4>THE FORE LIMB</h4>

<p>The bones of the fore limb, generally, correspond
in length with the similar parts of the hind limb.
The upper arm bone corresponds with the upper leg
bone, and the fore-arm bone is as long as the fore-leg
bone; then differences begin. The bones which
correspond to the back of the hand in man, termed
the metacarpus, are variable in length in Pterodactyles&mdash;sometimes
very long and sometimes short. The
wing metacarpal bone is always stout, and the others
are slender. The extremity of the metacarpus was
applied to the ground. Three small digits of the
hand are developed from the three small metacarpal
bones, and terminate in large claws.</p>

<p>The great wing finger was bent backward, and only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
touched the ground where it fitted upon the wing
metacarpal bone. It appears sometimes to have
been as long as the entire vertebral column.</p>

<p>Owing to the circumstance that the joint in the
arm in Pterodactyles was not at the wrist as among
birds, but between the metacarpus and the phalanges,
it follows that the fore limb was longer than the hind
limb when the metacarpus was long; but the difference
would not interfere with the movements of the
animal, either upon four feet or on two feet, for in bats
and birds the disproportion in length is greater.</p>


<h4>HUMERUS OR UPPER ARM BONE</h4>

<p>The first bone in the fore-arm, the humerus, is
remarkable chiefly for the compressed crescent form
of its upper articular end, which is never rounded
like the head of the upper arm bone in man, and
secondly for the great development of the external
process of bone near that end, termed the radial
crest. Sir Richard Owen compared the bone to the
humerus of both birds and crocodiles, but in its upper
articular end the crocodile bone may be said to be
more like a bird than it is like the Pterodactyle. In
flying reptiles the articular surface next to the shoulder-girdle
is somewhat saddle-shaped, being concave from
side to side above and convex vertically, while most
animals with which it can be compared have the
articular head of the bone convex in both directions.
A remarkable exception to this general rule is found
in some fossil animals from South Africa, which, from
resemblance to mammals in their teeth, have been
termed Theriodonts. They sometimes have the head
of the bone concave from side to side and convex in
the vertical direction. To this condition Ornithorhynchus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
makes a slight approximation. The singular
expansion of the structure called the radial crest
finds no close parallel in reptiles, though Crocodiles
have a moderate crest on the humerus in the same
position; and in Theriodonts the radial crest extends
much further down the shaft of the humerus. No
bird has a radial crest of a similar kind, though it
is prolonged some way down the shaft in Arch&aelig;opteryx.
In Pterodactyles it sometimes terminates
outward in a smooth, rounded surface, which might
have been articular if any structure could have articulated
with it. There is also a moderate expansion of
the bone on the ulnar side in some Pterodactyles, so
that the proximal end often incloses nearly three-fourths
of an ovate outline. The termination of the
radial crest is at the opposite end of this oval to the
wider articular part of the head of the bone, in
some specimens from the Cambridge Greensand. The
radial crest is more extended in Rhamphorhynchus.
All specimens of the humerus show a twist in the
length of the bone, so that the end towards the fore-arm,
which is wider than the shaft, makes a right
angle with the radial crest on the proximal end,
which is not seen in birds. The shaft of the humerus
is always stouter than that of the femur, though
different genera differ in this respect.</p>

<p>The humerus in genera from rocks associated with
the Chalk presents two modifications, chiefly seen in
the characters of the distal end of the bone. One of
these is a stout bone with a curiously truncated end
where it joins the two bones of the fore-arm; and
the other is more or less remarkable for the rounded
form of the distal condyles. Both types show distinct
articular surfaces. The inner one is somewhat oblique
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
and concave, the outer one rounded; the two being
separated by a concave channel, so that the ulna
makes an oblique articulation with the bone as in
birds, and the radius articulates by a more or less
truncated or concave surface.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_41" id="Fig_41"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 41. &nbsp;  COMPARISON OF THE HUMERUS IN
PTERODACTYLE AND BIRD</span>

</div>




<h4>ULNA AND RADIUS</h4>

<p>The bones of the fore-arm are similar to each other
in size, and if there be any difference between them
the ulna is slightly the larger. There is some evidence
that in Rhamphorhynchus the upper end of the ulna
was placed behind the radius, probably in consequence
of the mode of attachment of those bones to the
humerus. The ulna abutted towards the inner and
lower border, while the radius was towards the upper
border, consequent upon the twist in the humerus.
This condition corresponds substantially with the
arrangement in birds, but differs from birds in the
relatively more important part taken by the radius
in making the articulation. The bones are compared
in Dimorphodon with the Golden Eagle drawn of the
same size (<a href="#Fig_42">Fig. 42</a>). In birds the ulna supports the great
feathers of the wing, and this may account for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
size of the bone. The ulna is best seen at its proximal
end in the specimens from the Cambridge
Greensand, where there is a terminal olecranon ossification
forming an oblique articulation, which frequently
comes away and is lost. It is sometimes
well preserved, and indicated by a suture. The
examples of ulna from the Lias show a slight expansion
of the bone at both ends, and at the distal
end toward the wrist the articulation is well defined,
where the bone joins the carpus. The larger specimens
of the bone are broken. The distal articular
surface is only connected with the proximal end of
the bone in small specimens: it always shows on
the one margin a concavity, followed by a prominent
boss, and an oblique articulation beyond the boss.
On the side towards the radius, on the lower end of
the shaft there is an angular ridge, which marks the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
line along which the ulna overlaps the radius. The
lower end of the radius has a simple, slightly convex
articulation, somewhat bean-shaped. No rotation
of these bones on each other was possible as in
man. There is a third bone in the fore-arm. This
bone, named the pteroid, is commonly seen in skeletons
from Solenhofen. It was regarded by Von
Meyer as having supported the wing membrane in
flight. Some writers have interpreted it as an essential
part of the Pterodactyle skeleton, and Von
Meyer thought that it might possibly indicate a fifth
digit in the hand. The only existing structure at all
like it is seen in the South African insectivorous
mammal named <i>Chrysochloris capensis</i>, the golden
mole, which also has three bones in the fore-arm,
the third bone extending half-way up towards the
humerus. In that animal the third bone appears to
be behind the others and adjacent to the ulna. In
the German fossils the pteroid articulated with a
separate carpal or metacarpal bone, placed on the side
of the arm adjacent to the radius, and the radius
is always more inward than the ulna. If the view
suggested by Von Meyer is adopted, this bone would
be a first digit extending outward and backward
towards the humerus. That view was adopted by
Professor Marsh. It involves the interpretation of
what has been termed the lateral carpal as the first
metacarpal bone, which would be as short as that
of a bird, but turned in the opposite direction backward.
The first digit would then only carry one
phalange, and would not terminate in a claw, but lie
in the line of the tendon which supports the anterior
wing membrane of a bird.</p>

<p>The third bone in the fore-arm of Chrysochloris
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
does not appear to correspond to a digit. The bone
is on the opposite side of the arm to the similar
bone of a Pterodactyle, and therefore cannot be the
same structure in the Golden Mole. The interpretation
which makes the pteroid bone the first digit
has the merit of accounting for the fifth digit of the
hand. All the structures of the hand are consistent
with this view. The circumstance that the bone is
rarely found in contact with the radius, but diverging
from it, shows that it plays the same part in stretching
the membrane in advance of the arm, that the fifth
digit holds in supporting the larger wing membrane
behind the arm.</p>

<p>According to Professor Williston, the American
toothless Pterodactyle Ornithostoma has but a single
phalange on the corresponding first toe of the hind
foot, and that bone he describes as long, cylindrical,
gently curved, and bluntly pointed. There is some
support for this interpretation; but I have not seen
any English or German Pterodactyles with only one
phalange in the first toe.</p>

<p>The wing in Pterodactyles would thus be stretched
between two fingers which are bent backward, the
three intermediate digits terminating in claws.</p>


<h4>THE CARPUS</h4>

<p>The wrist bones in the reptilia usually consist of
two rows. In Crocodiles, in the upper row there is
a large inner and a small outer bone, behind which
is a lunate bone, the remainder of the carpus being
cartilaginous. Only one carpal is converted into
bone in the lower row. It is placed immediately
under the smaller upper carpal. In Chelonians, the
turtle and tortoise group, the characters of the carpus
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
vary with the family. In the upper row there are
usually two short carpals, which may be blended,
under the ulna; while the two under the radius are
commonly united. The lower row is made up of
several small bones. Lizards, too, usually have three
bones in the proximal row and five smaller bones
in the distal row.</p>

<p>The correspondence of the distal carpals with
the several metacarpal bones of the middle hand
is a well-known feature of the structure of the
wrist.</p>

<p>Von Meyer remarks that the carpus is made up of
two rows of small bones in the Solenhofen Pterodactyles;
while in birds there is one row consisting
of two bones. The structure of the carpus is not
distinct in all German specimens; but in the short-tailed
Solenhofen genera the bones in the two rows
retain their individuality.</p>

<p>In all the Cretaceous genera the carpal bones of
each row are blended into a single bone, so that two
bones are superimposed, which may be termed the
proximal and distal carpals. One specimen shows
by an indication of sutures the original division of
the distal carpal into three bones; and the separated
constituent bones are very rarely met with. Two
bones of the three confluent elements contribute to the
support of the wing metacarpal, and the third gives
an articular attachment to the bone which extends
laterally at the inner side of the carpus, which I
now think may be the first metacarpal bone turned
backward towards the humerus. The three component
bones meet in the circular pneumatic foramen
in the middle of the under side of the distal
carpal. There is no indication of division of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
proximal carpal in these genera into constituent
bones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_43" id="Fig_43"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 43. &nbsp;  CARPUS FROM ORNITHOCHEIRUS</span>

<img src="images/i_141.jpg" width="640" height="254" alt="FIG. 43." title="FIG. 43." />
</div>



<p>This condition is somewhat different from birds.
In 1873 Dr. Rosenberg, of Dorpat, showed that
there is in the bird a proximal carpal formed of two
elements, and a distal carpal also formed of two
elements. Therefore the two constituents of the
distal carpal in the bird which blends in the mature
animal with the metacarpus, forming the rounded
pulley joint, may correspond with two of the three
bones in the Cretaceous Pterodactyle <i>Ornithocheirus.</i></p>

<p>The width of a proximal carpal rarely exceeds two
inches, and that of a distal carpal is about an inch
and three-quarters. Two such bones when in contact
would not measure more than one inch in depth.
The lower surface shows that the wing had some
rotary movement upon the carpus outward and
backward.</p>


<h4>METACARPUS</h4>

<p>The metacarpus consists of bones which correspond
to the back of the hand. The first digit of
the hand in clawed animals has the metacarpal bone
short, or shorter than the others. Among mammals
metacarpal bones are sometimes greatly elongated;
and a similar condition is found in Pterodactyles, in
which the metacarpal bone may be much longer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
than the phalange which is attached to it. Two
metacarpal bones appear to be singularly stouter
than the others. The first bone of the first digit, if
rightly determined, is much shorter than the others,
and is, in fact, no longer than the carpus (<a href="#Fig_43">Fig. 43</a>). It
is a flat oblong bone, attached to the inner side of
the lower carpal, and instead of being prolonged
distally in the same direction as the other metacarpal
bones, is turned round and directed upward,
so that its upper edge is flush with the base of the
radius, and gives attachment to a bone which resembles
a terminal phalange of the wing finger.
According to this interpretation it is the first and
only phalange in the first digit. The bone is often
about half as long as the fore-arm, terminates upward
in a point, is sometimes curved, and frequently
diverges outward from the bones of the fore-arm,
as preserved in the associated skeleton, being
stretched towards the radial crest of the humerus.
This mode of attachment of the supposed first metacarpal,
which is true for all Cretaceous pterodactyles,
has not been shown to be the same for all those
from the Solenhofen Slate. There is no greater
anomaly in this metacarpal and phalange on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
inner side being bent backward, than there is in the
wing finger being bent backward on the outer side.
The three slender intervening digits extend forward
between them, as though they were applied to the
ground for walking.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">
<a name="Fig_44" id="Fig_44"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 44. &nbsp;  METACARPUS IN TWO ORNITHOSAURS</span>
<img src="images/i_142.jpg" width="640" height="336" alt="FIG. 44." title="FIG. 44." />
</div>


<p>The bone which is usually known as the wing
metacarpal is frequently stouter at the proximal end
towards the carpus than towards the phalange. At
the carpal end it is oblong and truncated, with a short
middle process, which may have extended into the
pit in the base of the carpal bone; while the distal
terminal end is rounded exactly like a pulley. There
is great difference in the length of the metacarpus.
In the American genus Ornithostoma it is much
longer than the fore-arm. In Rhamphorhynchus it
is remarkably short, though perhaps scarcely so
short as in Dimorphodon or in Scaphognathus. The
largest Cretaceous examples are about two inches
wide where they join the carpus. The bone is sometimes
a little curved.</p>

<p>Between the first and fifth or wing metacarpal are
the three slender metacarpal bones which give attachment
to the clawed digits. They bear much the
same relation to the wing metacarpal that the large
metatarsal of a Kangaroo has to the slender bones
of the instep which are parallel to it.</p>

<p>The facet for the wing metacarpal on the carpus is
clearly recognised, but as a rule there is no surface
with which the small metacarpals can be separately
articulated. One or two exceptional specimens from
the Cambridge Greensand appear to have not only
surfaces for the wing metacarpal, but two much
smaller articular surfaces, giving attachment to
smaller metacarpals; while in one case there appears
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
to be only one of these additional impressions. It
is certain that all the animals from the Lias and
Oolites have three clawed digits, but at present I
have seen no evidence that there were three in the
Cretaceous genera, though Professor Williston's statements
and restoration appear to show that the
toothless Pterodactyles have three. Another difference
from the Oolitic types, according to Professor
Williston, is in the length of the slender metacarpals
of the clawed phalanges being about one-third that
of the wing metacarpal, but this is probably due to
imperfect ossification at the proximal end; for at the
distal end the bones all terminated on the same level,
showing that the four outer digits were applied to
the ground to support the weight of the body. The
corresponding bone in the Horse and Oxen is carried
erect, so as to be in a vertical line with the bones of
the fore-arm; and the same position prevails usually,
though not invariably, with the corresponding bone
in the hind limb, while in many clawed mammals the
metacarpus and metatarsus are both applied upon the
ground. In Pterodactyles the metatarsal bones are
preserved in the rock in the same straight line with
the smaller bones of the foot, or make an angle with
the shin bone, leading to the conviction that the bones
of the foot were applied to the ground as in Man,
and sometimes as in the Dog, and were thus modified
for leaping. Just as the human metacarpus is extended
in the same line with the bones of the fore-arm,
and the movement of jointing occurs where the
fingers join the metacarpus, so Pterodactyles also
had these bones differently modified in the fore and
hind limbs for the functions of life. The result is to
lengthen the fore limb as compared with the hind
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
limb by introducing into it an elevation above the
ground which corresponds to the length of the metacarpus,
always supposing that the animal commonly
assumed the position of a quadruped when upon the
earth's surface.</p>

<p>This position of the metacarpus is a remarkable
difference from Birds, because when the bird's wing
is at rest it is folded into three portions. The upper
arm bone extends backward, the bones of the fore-arm
are bent upon it so as to extend forward, and
then at the wrist the third portion, which includes
the metacarpus and finger bones, is bent backward.
So that the metacarpus in the Pterodactyle differs from
birds in being in the same line as the bones of the
fore-arm, whereas in birds it is in the same line with
the digit bones of the hand. It is worthy of remark
that in Bats, which are so suggestive of Pterodactyles
in some features of the hand, the metacarpals and
phalanges are in the same straight line; so that in
this respect the bat is more like the bird. But Pterodactyles
in the relation of these bones to flight are
quite unlike any other animal, and have nothing in
common with the existing animals named Reptiles.</p>


<h4>THE HAND</h4>

<p>From what has just been said it follows that the
construction of the hand is unique. It may be contrasted
with the foot of a bird. The bone which
is called, in the language of anatomists, the tarso-metatarsus,
and is usually free from feathers and
covered with skin, is commonly carried erect in birds,
so that the whole body is supported upon it; and
from it the toes diverge outward. It is formed in
birds of three separate bones blended together. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the fore limb of the Pterodactyle the metacarpus
has the same relation to the bones of the fore-arm
that the metatarsus has to the corresponding bones
of the leg in a bird. But the three metacarpal bones
in the Pterodactyle remain distinct from each other,
perhaps because the main work of that region of the
skeleton has devolved upon the digit called the wing
finger, which is not recognised in the bird. In the
Pterodactyles from the Solenhofen Slate there is
a progressive number of phalanges in the three small
digits of the hand, which were applied to the ground.
This number in the great majority of species follows
the formula of two bones in the first, three bones in
second, and four in the third; so that in the innermost
of the clawed digits only one bone intervenes between
the metacarpal and the claw. The fingers slightly
increase in length with increase in number of bones
which form them.</p>

<img src="images/i_146.jpg" width="640" height="208" alt="FIG. 45." title="FIG. 45." />
</div>


<p>The terminal claw bones are unlike the claws of
Birds or Reptiles. They are compressed from side to
side, and extremely deep and strong, with evidence of
powerful attachment for ligaments, so that they rather
resemble in their form and large size the claws of
some of the carnivorous fossil reptiles, often grouped
as Dinosauria, such as have been termed Aristosuchus
and Megalosaurus. In the hand of the
Ostrich the first and second digits terminate in
claws, while the third is without a claw. But these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
claws of the Ostrich and other birds are slender,
curved, and rather feeble organs. In the Arch&aelig;opteryx,
a fossil bird which agrees with the Pterodactyles
in retaining the separate condition of the metacarpal
bones and in having the same number of phalanges
in two of the fingers of the fore limb, the terminal
claws are rather more compressed from side to side,
and stronger than in the Ostrich, but not nearly so
strong as in the Pterodactyle. The Arch&aelig;opteryx
differs from the Pterodactyle in having no trace of a
wing finger. The first metacarpal bone is short,
as in all birds; and the first phalange scarcely
lengthens that segment of the first digit of the Bird's
hand to the same length as the other metacarpal
bones. It therefore was not bent backward like the
first digit in Pterodactyles. The wing finger, from
which the genius of Cuvier selected the scientific
name&mdash;Pterodactyle&mdash;for these fossils, yields their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
most distinctive character. It is a feature which could
only be partly paralleled in the Bat, by making
changes of structure which would remove every
support to the wing but the outermost digit of that
animal's hand. In the Bat's hand the membrane for
flight is extended chiefly by four diverging metacarpal
bones. There are only two or three phalanges in each
digit in its four wing fingers. In Pterodactyles the
metacarpal bones are, as we have seen, arranged in
close contact, and take no part in stretching the wing.</p>

</div>



<h4>THE WING FINGER</h4>

<p>In Birds there is nothing whatever to represent the
wing finger of the Pterodactyle, for it is an organ
external to the finger bones of the bird, and contains
four phalanges. The first phalange is quite different
from the others. Its length is astonishing when compared
with the small phalanges of the clawed fingers.
The articular surface, which joins on to the wing
metacarpal bone, is a concave articulation, which fits
the pulley in which that bone ends. The pulley
articulation admits of an extension movement in
one direction only. Many specimens show the wing
finger to be folded up so as to extend backward.
The whole finger is preserved in other specimens
straightened out so as to be in line with the metacarpus.
This condition is well seen in Professor
Marsh's specimen of Rhamphorhynchus, which has
the wing membrane preserved, in which all bones
of the fore-arm metacarpus and wing finger are
extended in a continuous curve. The outer surface
of the end of the first bone of the wing finger
overlaps the wing metacarpal, so that a maximum
of strength and resistance is provided in the bony
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
structures by which the wing is supported. There
is, therefore, in flight only one angular bend in the
limb, and that is between the upper arm bone and
the fore-arm.</p>

<p>An immense pneumatic foramen is situate in a
groove on the under side of the upper end of the
first phalange in Ornithocheirus, but is absent in
specimens from the Kimeridge clay. This bone is
long and stout. It terminates at the lower end in
an obliquely truncated articular surface. Specimens
occur in the Cambridge Greensand which are 2 inches
broad at the upper end and nearly 1&frac12; inch wide at
the lower end. An imperfect bone from the Chalk
is 14&frac12; inches long. The bones are all flattened.
Specimens from the Chalk of Kansas at Munich are
28 inches long. The second phalange is concave at
the upper articular end and convex in the longer
direction at the lower end. The articular points of
union between the several phalanges form prominences
on the under side of the finger in consequence
of the adjacent bones being a little widened at their
junction. It should be mentioned that there is a
proximal epiphysis or separate bone to the first
phalange, adjacent to the pulley joint of the metacarpal
bone, which is like the separate olecranon process
of the ulna of the fore-arm. It sometimes comes
away in specimens from the Chalk and Cambridge
Greensand, leaving a large circular pit with a depressed
narrow border. On the outer side of this
process is a rounded boss, which may possibly have
supported the bone, if it were applied to the ground
with the wing folded up, like the wing of a Bat directed
upward and backward at the animal's side.</p>

<p>The four bones of the wing finger usually decrease
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
progressively in length, so that in Rhamphorhynchus,
in which the length of the animal's head only slightly
exceeds 3&frac12; inches, the first phalange is nearly as long,
the second phalange is about 3&frac14; inches, the third 2&frac34;
inches, and the fourth a little over 2 inches. Thus
the entire length of the four phalanges slightly exceeds
11 inches, or rather more than three times the
length of the head. But the fore-arm and metacarpus
in this type only measure 3 inches. Therefore the
entire spread of wings could not have been more
than 2 feet 9 inches.</p>

<p>The largest Ornithosaur in which accurate measurements
have been made is the toothless Pterodactyle
Ornithostoma, also named Pteranodon, from North
America. In that type the head appears to have
been about 3 or 4 feet long, and the wing finger
exceeded 5 feet; while the length of the fore-arm
and metacarpus exceeded 3 feet. The width of the
body would not have been more than 1 foot. The
length of the short humerus, which was about
11 inches, did not add greatly to the stretch of the
wing; so that the spread of the wings as stretched
in flight may be given as probably not exceeding
17 or 18 feet. A fine example of the wing bones of
this animal quite as large has been obtained by the
(British Museum Natural History). Many years ago,
on very fragmentary materials, I estimated the wings
in the English Cretaceous Ornithocheirus as probably
having a stretch of 20 feet in the largest specimens,
basing the calculation partly upon the extent of the
longest wings in existing birds relatively to their
bones, and partly upon the size of the largest associated
bones which were then known.</p>

EVIDENCES OF THE ANIMAL'S
HABITS FROM ITS REMAINS</h2>


<p>Such are the more remarkable characters of the
bones in a type of animal life which was more
anomalous than any other which peopled the earth
in the Secondary Epoch of geological time. Its
skeleton in different parts resembles Reptiles, Birds,
and Mammals; with modifications and combinations
so singular that they might have been deemed impossible
if Nature's power of varying the skeleton
could be limited. Since Ornithosaurs were provided
with wings, we may believe the animals to some extent
to have resembled birds in habit. Their modes of
progression were more varied, for the structures indicate
an equal capacity for movement on land as a
biped, or as a quadruped, with movement in the air.
There is little evidence to support the idea that they
were usually aquatic animals. The majority of birds
which frequent the water have their bodies stored
with fat and the bones of their extremities filled with
marrow. And a bird's marrow bones are stouter and
stronger than those which are filled with air. There
are few, if any, bones of Pterodactyles so thick as to
suggest the conclusion that they contained marrow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and the bones of the extremities appear to have been
constructed on the lightest type found among terrestrial
birds. Their thinness, except in a few specimens
from the Wealden rocks, is marvellous; and all the
later Pterodactyles show the arrangement, as in birds,
by which air from the lungs is conveyed to the
principal bones. No Pterodactyle has shown any
trace of the web-footed condition seen in birds which
swim on the water, unless the diverging bones of the
hind foot in Rhamphorhynchus supports that inference.
The bones of the hind foot are relatively
small, and if it were not that a bird stands easily
upon one foot, might be considered scarcely adequate
to support the animal in the position which terrestrial
birds usually occupy. Yet, as compared with the
length and breadth of the foot in an Ostrich, the toes
of an Ornithosaur are seen to be ample for support.
These facts appear to discourage the idea that the
animals were equally at home on land and water, and
in air.</p>

<p>Some light may be thrown upon the animal's habits
by the geological circumstances under which the
remains are found. The Pterodactyle named Dimorphodon,
from the Lias of the south of England, is
associated with evidences of terrestrial land animals,
the best known of which is Scelidosaurus, an armoured
Dinosaur adapted by its limbs for progression
on land. And the Pterodactyle Campylognathus,
from the Lias of Whitby, is associated with trunks
of coniferous trees and remains of Insects. So that
the occurrence of Pterodactyles in a marine stratum
is not inconsistent with their having been transported
by streams from off the old land surface of the Lias,
on which coniferous trees grew and Dinosaurs lived.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Similar considerations apply to the occurrence of
the Rhamphocephalus in the Stonesfield Slate of
England. The deposit is not only formed in shallow
water, but contains terrestrial Insects, a variety of
land plants, and many Reptiles and other animals
which lived upon land. The specimens from the
Purbeck beds, again, are in strata which yield a
multitude of the spoils of a nearly adjacent land
surface; while the numerous remains found in the
marine Solenhofen Slate in Germany are similarly
associated with abundant evidences of varied types
of terrestrial life. The evidence grows in force from
its cumulative character. The Wealden beds, which
yield many terrestrial reptiles and so much evidence
of terrestrial vegetation, and shallow-water conditions
of disposition, have afforded important Pterodactyle
remains from the Isle of Wight and Sussex.</p>

<p>The chief English deposit in which these fossils
are found, the Upper Greensand, has afforded
thousands of bones, battered and broken on a
shore, where they have lain in little associated
groups of remains, often becoming overgrown with
small marine shells. Side by side with them are
found bones of true terrestrial Lizards and Crocodiles
of the type of the Gavial of the Indian rivers, many
terrestrial Dinosaurs, and other evidences of land
life, including fossil resins, such as are met with in
the form of amber or copal at the present day.</p>

<p>The great bones of Pterodactyles found in the
Chalk of Kent, near Rochester, became entombed,
beyond question, far from a land surface. There is
nothing to show whether the animals died on land
and were drifted out to sea like the timber which is
found water-logged and sunken after being drilled by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
the ship-worm (Teredo) of that epoch. Seeing the
power of flight which the animal possessed, storms
may have struck down travellers from time to time,
when far from land.</p>

<p>Evidence of habit of another kind may be found
in their teeth. They are brightly enamelled, sharp,
formidable; and are frequently long, overlapping the
sides of the jaws. They are organs which are often
better adapted for grasping than for tearing, as may
be seen in the inclined teeth of Rhamphocephalus of
the Stonesfield Slate; and better adapted for killing
than tearing, from their piercing forms and cutting
edges, in genera like Ornithocheirus of the Greensand.
The manner in which the teeth were implanted and
carried is better paralleled by the fish-eating crocodile
of Indian rivers than by the flesh-eating crocodiles, or
Muggers, which live indifferently in rivers and the
sea. As the Kingfisher finds its food (see <a href="#Fig_20">Fig. 20</a>)
from the surface of the water without being in the
common sense of the term a water bird, so some
Pterodactyles may have fed on fish, for which their
teeth are well adapted, both in the stream and by the
shore.</p>

<p>A Pterodactyle's teeth vary a good deal in appearance.
The few large teeth in the front of the jaw
in Dimorphodon, associated with the many small
vertical teeth placed further backward, suggest that
the taking of food may have been a process requiring
leisure, since the hinder teeth adapted to
mincing the animal's meat are extremely small. The
way in which the teeth are shaped and arranged
differs with the genera. In Pterodactylus they are
short and broad and few, placed for the most part
towards the front of the jaws. Their lancet-shaped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
form indicates a shear-like action adapted to dividing
flesh. In the associated genus Rhamphorhynchus
the teeth are absent from the extremity of the jaw,
are slender, pointed, spaced far apart, and extend far
backward. When the jaws of the Rhamphorhynchus
are brought together there is always a gap between
them in front, which has led to belief that the teeth
were replaced by some kind of horny armature which
has perished. In the long-nosed English type of
Ornithocheirus the jaws are compressed together, so
that the teeth of the opposite sides are parallel to
each other, with the margins well filled with teeth,
which are never in close contact, though occasionally
closer and larger in front, in some of the forms with
thick truncated snouts.</p>

<p>It is not the least interesting circumstance of the
dentition of Pterodactyles that, associated in the
same deposits with these most recent genera with
teeth powerfully developed, there is a genus named
Ornithostoma from the resemblance of its mouth to
that of a bird in being entirely devoid of teeth. It
is scarcely possible to distinguish the remains of the
toothed and toothless skeletons except in the dentary
character of the jaws. There is no evidence that
the toothless types ever possessed a tooth of any
sort. They were first found in fragments in England
in the Cambridge Greensand, but were afterwards
met with in great abundance in the Chalk of Kansas,
where the same animals were named Pteranodon.
A jaw so entirely bird-like suggests that the digestive
organs of Pterodactyles may in such toothless forms
at least have been characterised by a gizzard, which
is so distinctive of Birds. The absence of teeth in
the Great Ant-eater and some other allied Mammals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
has transferred the function which teeth usually perform
to the stomach, one part of which becomes
greatly thickened and muscular, adapting itself to
the work which it has to perform. It is probable
that the gizzard may be developed in relation to the
necessities which food creates, since even Trout, feeding
on the shell-fish in some Irish lochs, acquire such
a thickened muscular stomach, and a like modification
is recorded in other fishes as produced by
food.</p>

<p>Closely connected with an animal's habits is the
protection to the body which is afforded by the skin.
In Pterodactyles the evidence of the condition of
the skin is scanty, and mostly negative. Sometimes
the dense, smooth texture of the jaw bones indicates
a covering like the skin of a Lizard or the hinder part
of the jaw of a Bird. Some jaws from the Cambridge
Greensand have the bone channeled over its
surface by minute blood vessels which have impressed
themselves into the bone more easily than
into its covering. Thus in the species of Ornithocheirus
distinguished as <i>microdon</i> the palate is
absolutely smooth, while in the species named
<i>mach&aelig;rorhynchus</i> it is marked by parallel impressed
vascular grooves which diverge from the median
line. This condition clearly indicates a difference in
the covering of the bone, and that in the latter
species the covering had fewer blood vessels and
more horny protection than in the other. The tissue
may not have been of firmer consistence than in the
palate of Mammals. The extremity of the beak is
often as full of blood vessels as the jaw of a Turtle
or Crocodile.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<h4>COVERING OF THE BODY</h4>

<p>There is no trace even in specimens from the
Solenhofen or Stonesfield Slate of any covering to
the body. There are no specimens preserved like
mummies, and although the substance of the wings
is found there is no trace of fur or feathers, bones,
or scales on the skin. The only example in which
there is even an appearance suggesting feathers is in
the beautiful Scaphognathus at Bonn, and upon portions
of the wing membrane of that specimen are
preserved a very few small short and apparently
tubular bodies, which have a suggestive resemblance
to the quills of small undeveloped feathers. Such
evidences have been diligently sought for. Professor
Marsh, after examining the wing membranes of his
specimen of Rhamphorhynchus from Solenhofen,
stated that the wings were partially folded and
naturally contracted into folds, and that the surface
of the tissue is marked by delicate stri&aelig;, which
might easily be taken at first sight for a thin coating
of hair. Closer investigation proved the markings
to be minute wrinkles on the under surface of the
wing membrane. This negative evidence has considerable
value, because the Solenhofen Slate has
preserved in the two known examples of the bird
Arch&aelig;opteryx beautiful details of the structure of
the larger feathers concerned in flight. It has preserved
many structures far more delicate. There is,
therefore, reason for believing that if the skin had
possessed any covering like one of those found in
existing vertebrate animals, it could scarcely have
escaped detection in the numerous undisturbed skeletons
of Pterodactyles which have been examined.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>The absence of a recognisable covering to the skin
in a fossil state cannot be accepted as conclusive
evidence of the temperature, habits, or affinities of
the animal. Although Mammalia are almost entirely
clothed with dense hair, which has never been
found in a recognisable condition in a fossil state in
any specimen of Tertiary age, one entire order, the
Cetacea, show in the smooth hairless skins of Whales
and Porpoises that the class may part with the
typical characteristic covering without loss of temperature
and without intelligible cause. That the absence
of hair is not due to the aquatic conditions of rivers
or sea is proved by other marine Mammals, like Seals,
having the skin clothed with a dense growth of hair,
which is not surpassed in any other order. The fineness
of the growth of hair in Man gives a superficial
appearance of the skin being imperfectly clothed,
and a similar skin in a fossil state might give the
impression that it was devoid of hair. There are
many Mammals in which the skin is scantily clothed
with hair as the animal grows old. Neither the
Elephant nor the Armadillo in a fossil state would be
likely to have the hair preserved, for the growth is
thin on the bony shields of the living Armadilloes.
Yet the difficulty need be no more inherent in the
nature of hair than in that of feathers, since the hair
of the Mammoth and Rhinoceros has been completely
preserved upon their skins in the tundras of
Siberia, densely clothing the body. This may go
to show that the Pterodactyle possessed a thin
covering of hair, or, more probably, that hair
was absent. Since Reptiles are equally variable in
the clothing of the skin with bony or horny plates,
and in sometimes having no such protection, it may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
not appear singular that the skin in Ornithosaurs has
hitherto given no evidence of a covering. From
analogy a covering might have been expected;
feathers of Birds and hair of Mammals are non-conducting
coverings suited to arrest the loss of heat.</p>

<p>With the evidence, such as it is, of resemblance of
Ornithosaurs to Birds in some features of respiration
and flight, a covering to the skin might have been
expected. Yet the covering may not be necessary
to a high temperature of the blood. Since Dr. John
Davy made his observations it has been known that
the temperature of the Tunny, above 90&deg; Fahrenheit,
is as warm as the African scaly ant-eater named the
Pangolin, which has the body more amply protected
by its covering. This illustration also shows that
hot blood may be produced without a four-celled
heart, with which it is usually associated, and that
even if the skin in Pterodactyles was absolutely
naked an active life and an abundant supply of blood
could have given the animal a high temperature.</p>

<p>The circumstance that in several individuals the
substance of the wing membrane is preserved would
appear to indicate either that it was exceptionally
stout when there would have been small chance of
resisting decomposition, or that its preservation is
due to a covering which once existed of fur or down
or other clothing substance, which has proved more
durable than the skin itself.</p>

ANCIENT ORNITHOSAURS FROM THE LIAS</h2>


<p>Cuvier's discourse on the revolutions of the
Earth made the Pterodactyle known to English
readers early in the nineteenth century. Dr. Buckland,
the distinguished professor of Geology at
Oxford, discovered in 1829 a far larger specimen in
the Lias of Lyme Regis, and it became known by a
figure published by the Geological Society, and by the
description in his famous Bridgewater Treatise, p. 164.
This animal was tantalising in imperfect preservation.
The bones were scattered in the clay, so as to give no
idea of the animal's aspect. Knowledge of its limbs
and body has been gradually acquired; and now, for
some years, the tail and most parts of the skeleton
have been well known in this oldest and most
interesting British Pterodactyle.</p>

<p>Sir Richard Owen after some time separated the
fossil as a distinct genus, named Dimorphodon; for
it was in many ways unlike the Pterodactyles described
from Bavaria. The name Dimorphodon indicated
the two distinct kinds of teeth in the jaws,
a character which is still unparalleled among Pterodactyles
of newer age. There are a few large pointed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
piercing and tearing teeth in the front of the jaws,
with smaller teeth further back, placed among the
tearing teeth in the upper jaw; while in the lower
jaw the small teeth are continuous, close-set, and
form a fine cutting edge like a saw.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">
<a name="Fig_49" id="Fig_49"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 49. &nbsp; LEFT SIDE OF DIMORPHODON (RESTORED) AT REST</span>
<img src="images/i_163.jpg" width="1024" height="470" alt="FIG. 49." title="FIG. 49." />
</div>

<p>The Dimorphodon has a short beak, a deep head,
and deep lower jaw, which is overlapped by the cheek
bones. The side of the head is occupied by four
vacuities, separated by narrow bars of bone. First, in
front, is the immense opening for the nostril, triangular
in form, with the long upper side following the rounded
curve of the face. A large triangular opening intervenes
between the nose hole and the eye hole, scarcely
smaller than the former, but much larger than the
orbit of the eye. The eye hole is shaped like a kite
or inverted pear. Further back still is a narrower vertical
opening known as the lateral or inferior temporal
vacuity. The back of the head is badly preserved.
The two principal skulls differ in depth, probably
from the strains under which they were pressed flat
in the clay. A singular detail of structure is found
in the extremity of the lower jaw, which is turned
slightly downward, and terminates in a short toothless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
point. The head of Dimorphodon is about eight inches
long.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">
<a name="Fig_50" id="Fig_50"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 50. &nbsp; DIMORPHODON MACRONYX<br /><br />
RESTORED FORM OF THE ANIMAL</span>
<img src="images/i_165.jpg" width="1024" height="523" alt="FIG. 50." title="FIG. 50." />
</div>

<p>The neck bones are of suitable stoutness and width
to support the head. The bones are yoked together
by strong processes. The neck was about 6 inches
long, did not include more than seven bones, and
appeared short owing only to the depth and size of
the head. The length of the backbone which supported
the ribs was also about 6 inches. Its joints
are remarkably short when compared with those of
the neck. The tail is about 20 inches long.</p>

<p>The extreme length of the animal from the tip
of the nose to the end of the tail may have been
3 feet 4 inches, supposing it to have walked on all
fours in the manner of a Reptile or Mammal. This
may have been a common position, but Dimorphodon
may probably also have been a biped. Before
1875, when the first restoration appeared in the
<i>Illustrated London News</i>, the legs had been regarded
as too short to have supported the animal, standing
upon its hind limbs. They are here seen to be well
adapted for such a purpose. The upper leg bone is
3&frac14; inches long, the lower leg bone is 4&frac12; inches
long, and the singularly strong instep bones are
firmly packed together side by side as in a leaping
or jumping Mammal, and measure 1&frac12; inches
in length. Dimorphodon differs from several other
Pterodactyles in having the hind limb provided
with a fifth outermost short instep bone, to which
two toe bones are attached. These bones are elongated
in a way that may be compared, on a small
scale, with the elongation of the wing finger in the
fore limb. The digit was manifestly used in the same
way as the wing finger, in partial support of a flying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
membrane, though its direction may have been upward
and outward, rather than inward. There is no
evidence of a pulley joint between the metatarsal
and the adjacent phalange.</p>

<p>The height of the Dimorphodon, standing on its
hind legs in the position of a Bird, with the wings
folded upon the body in the manner of a Bird, was
about 20 inches. An ungainly, ill-balanced animal
in aspect, but not more so than many big-headed
birds, and probably capable of resting upon the instep
bones as many birds do. The chief point of variation
from the Pterodactyle wing is in the relative
length of the metacarpus in Dimorphodon. It is
shorter than the other bones in the wing, never
exceeding 1&frac12; inches. The total length of all
the arm bones down to the point where the metacarpus
might have touched the ground, or where
the wing finger is bent upon it, is about 9 inches,
which gives a length of less than 6 inches below
the upper arm bone. The four bones of the wing
finger measure, from the point where the first bone
bends upon the metacarpus, less than 18 inches.
So that the wings could only have been carried
in the manner of the wings of a Bat, folded at the
side and directed obliquely over the back when the
animal moved on all fours. Its body would appear
to have been raised high above the ground, in a
manner almost unparalleled in Reptiles, and comparable
to Birds and Mammals. Dimorphodon is to
be imagined in full flight, with the body extended
like that of a Bird, when the wings would have
had a spread from side to side of about 4 feet 4
inches. As in other animals of this group, the three
claws on the front feet are larger than the similar
four claws on the hind feet; as though the fingers
might have functions in grasping prey, which were
not shared by the toes.</p>

<p>A second English Pterodactyle is found in the
Upper Lias of Whitby. It is only known from
an imperfect skull, published in 1888. It has the
great advantage of preserving the bones in their
natural relations to each other, and with a length of
head probably similar to Dimorphodon shows that
the depth at the back of the eye was much less; and
the skull wants the arched contour of face seen in
Dimorphodon. The head has the same four lateral
vacuities, but the nostril is relatively small and elongated,
extending partly above the oval antorbital
opening, which was larger. There is thus a difference
of proportion, but it is precisely such as might result
from the species having the skull flatter. The head
is easily distinguished by the small nostril, which
is smaller than the orbit of the eye. The animal
is referred to another genus. The quadrate bones
which give attachment to the lower jaw send a process
inward to meet the bones of the palate, which differ
somewhat from the usual condition. Two bony rods
extend from the quadrate bones backward and upward
to the sphenoid, and two more slender bones
extend from the quadrate bones forward, and converge
in a <b>V</b>-shape, to define the division between
the openings of the nostrils on the palate. The
<b>V</b>-shaped bone in front is called the vomer, while
the hinder part is called pterygoid. The bones that
extend backward to the sphenoid are not easily identified.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
This animal is one of the most interesting
of Pterodactyles from the very reptilian character
exhibited in the back of the head, which appears to
be different from other specimens, which are more
like a bird in that region. Yet underneath this
reptilian aspect, with the bony bar at the side of the
temporal region of the head formed by the squamosal
and quadrate bones, defining the two temporal vacuities
as in Reptiles, a mould is preserved of the
cavity once occupied by the brain, showing the chief
details of structure of that organ, and proving that
in so far as it departs from the brain of a Bird it
appears to resemble the brain of a Mammal, and is
unlike the brain of a Reptile.</p>

<p>The Pterodactyles from the Lias of Germany are
similar to the English types, in so far as they can be
compared. In 1878 I had the opportunity of studying
those which were preserved in the Castle at Banz,
which Professor Andreas Wagner, in 1860, referred to
the new genus Dorygnathus. The skull is unknown,
but the lower jaw, 6&frac12; inches long, is less than 2&frac12; inches
wide at the articulation with the quadrate bone in the
skull. The depth of the lower jaw does not exceed
&frac14; inch, so that it is in marked contrast to Buckland's
Dimorphodon. The symphysis, which completely
blends the rami of the jaw, is short. As far as it
extends it contains large tearing teeth, followed by
smaller teeth behind, like those of Dimorphodon.
But this German fossil appears to differ from the
English type in having the front of the lower jaw, for
about &frac34; inch, compressed from side to side into a
sharp blade or spear, more marked than in any
other Pterodactyle, and directed <i>upward</i> instead of
downward as in Dimorphodon.  Nearly all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
measurements in the skeleton are practically identical
with those of the English Dimorphodon, and
extend to the jaw, humerus, ulna and radius, wing
metacarpal, first phalange of the wing finger. The
principal bones of the hind limb appear to be a little
shorter; but the scapula and coracoid are slightly
larger. All these bones are so similar in form to
Dimorphodon that they could not be separated from
the Lyme Regis species, if they were found in the
same locality.</p>

<p>Just as the Upper Lias in England has yielded a
second Pterodactyle, so the Upper Lias in Germany
has yielded a skeleton, to which Felix Plieninger, in
1894, gave the name Campylognathus. It is an instructive
skeleton, with the head much smaller than
in Dimorphodon, being less than 6 inches long, but,
unfortunately, broken and disturbed. A lower jaw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
gives the length 4&frac12; inches. Like the other Pterodactyles
from the Lias, it has the extremity of the
beak toothless, with larger teeth in the region of the
symphysis in front and smaller teeth behind. The jaw
is deeper than in the Banz specimen from the Lower
Lias, but not so deep as in Dimorphodon. The teeth
of the upper jaw vary in size, and there appears to
be an exceptionally large tooth in the position of
the Mammalian canine at the junction of the bones
named maxillary and intermaxillary.</p>

<p>The nasal opening is small and elongated, as in the
English specimen from Whitby. As in that type
there is little or no indication of the convex contour
of the face seen in Dimorphodon.</p>

<p>The neck does not appear to be preserved. In the
back the vertebr&aelig; are about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch long, so that
twelve, which is the usual number, would only occupy
a length of a little more than 3&frac12; inches. The tail is
elongated like that of Dimorphodon, and bordered
in the same way by ossified ligaments. There are
thirty-five tail vertebr&aelig;. Those which immediately
follow the pelvis are short, like the vertebr&aelig; of the
back. But they soon elongate, and reach a maximum
length of nearly 1&frac12; inches at the eighth, and
then gradually diminish till the last scarcely exceeds
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch in length. The length of the tail is
about 22 inches; this appears to be an inch or
two longer than in Dimorphodon. The longest rib
measures 2&frac12; inches, and the shortest 2 inches. These
ribs probably were connected with the sternum, which
is imperfectly preserved.</p>

<p>The bones of the limbs have about the same length
as those of Dimorphodon, so far as they can be compared,
except that the ulna and radius are shorter.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
The wing metacarpal is of about the same length,
but the first phalange of the wing finger measures
6&frac14; inches, the second is about 8&frac14; inches, the third
6&frac12; inches, and the fourth 4&frac34; inches; so that the total
length of the wing finger was about half an inch short
of 2 feet. One character especially deserves attention
in the apparent successive elongation of the first three
phalanges in the wing finger in Dimorphodon. The
third phalange is the longest in the only specimen in
which the finger bones are all preserved. Usually the
first phalange is much longer than the second, so that
it is a further point of interest to find that this German
type shares with Dimorphodon a character of
the wing finger which distinguishes both from some
members of the group by its short first phalange.</p>

<p>The pelvis is exceptionally strong in Campylognathus,
and although it is crushed the bones manifestly
met at the base of the ischium, while the pubic
bones were separated from each other in front. The
bones of the hind limb are altogether shorter in the
German fossil than in Dimorphodon, especially in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the tibia; but the structure of the metatarsus is just
the same, even to the short fifth metatarsal with its
two digits, only those bones are extremely short, instead
of being elongated as in Dimorphodon. It is
therefore convenient, from the different proportions
of the body, that Campylognathus may be separated
from Dimorphodon; but so much as is preserved of
the English specimen from the Upper Lias of Whitby
rather favours the belief that our species should also
be referred to Campylognathus, which had not been
figured when the Whitby skull was referred to Scaphognathus
by Mr. Newton. It may be doubtful whether
there is sufficient evidence to establish the distinctness
of the other German genus Dorygnathus, though
it may be retained pending further knowledge.</p>

<p>In these characters are grounds for placing the
Lias Pterodactyles in a distinct family, the Dimorphodontid&aelig;,
as was suggested in 1870. This evidence
is found in the five metatarsal bones, of which four
are in close contact, the middle two being slightly
the longest, so as to present the general aspect of the
corresponding bones in a Mammal rather than a Bird.
Secondly, the very slender fibula, prolonged down the
length of the shin bone, which ends in a rounded
pulley like the corresponding bone of a Bird. Thirdly,
the great elongation of the third wing phalange.
Fourthly, the prolongation of the coracoid bone beyond
the articulation for the humerus, as in a Bird.
And the toothless, spear-shaped beak, and jaw with
large teeth in front and small teeth behind, are also
distinctive characters.</p>

ORNITHOSAURS FROM THE
MIDDLE SECONDARY ROCKS</h2>


<h4>RHAMPHOCEPHALUS</h4>

<p>The Stonesfield Slate in England, which corresponds
in age with the lower part of the Great
or Bath Oolite, yields many evidences of terrestrial
life&mdash;land plants, insects, and mammals&mdash;preserved in
a marine deposit. A number of isolated bones have
been found of Pterodactyles, some of them indicating
animals of considerable size and strength. The
nature of the limestone was unfavourable to the preservation
of soft wing membranes, or even to the bones
remaining in natural association. Very little is known
of the head of Rhamphocephalus. One imperfect specimen
shows a long temporal region which is wide, and
a very narrow interspace between the orbits; with a
long face, indicated by the extension of narrow
nasal bones. The lower jaw has an edentulous beak
or spear in front, which is compressed from side to
side in the manner of the Liassic forms, but turned
upward slightly, as in Dorygnathus or Campylognathus.
Behind this extremity are sharp, tall teeth,
few in number, which somewhat diminish in size as
they extend backward, and do not suddenly change
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
to smaller series, as in the Lias genera. A few small
vertebr&aelig; have been found, indicating the neck and
back. The sacrum consists of five vertebr&aelig;. One
small example has a length of only an inch. It is
a little narrower behind than in front, and would be
consistent with the animal having had a long tail,
which I believe to have been present, although I
have not seen any caudal vertebr&aelig;. The early ribs
are like the early ribs of a Crocodile or Bird in the
well-marked double articulation. The later ribs
appear to have but one head. <b>V</b>-shaped abdominal
ribs are preserved. Much of the animal is unknown.
The coracoid seems to have been directed forward,
and, as in a bird, it is 2&frac12; inches long. The humerus
is 3&frac12; inches long, and the fore-arm measured 6
inches, so that it was relatively longer than in Dimorphodon.
The metacarpus is 1&frac34; inches long. The
wing finger was exceptionally long and strong. Professor
Huxley gave its length at 29 inches. My own
studies lead to the conclusion that the first finger
bone of the wing was the shorter, and that although
they did not differ greatly in length, the second was
probably the longest, as in Campylognathus.</p>

<p>Professor Huxley makes the second and third
phalanges 7&frac34; inches long, and the first only about
<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch shorter, while the fourth phalange is 6&frac12; inches.
These measurements are based upon some specimens
in the Oxford University Museum. There is only
one first phalange which has a length of 7&frac34; inches.
The others are between 5 and 6 inches, or but little
exceed 4 inches; so that as all the fourth phalanges
which are known have a length of 6&frac12; inches, it is
possible that the normal length of the first phalange
in the larger species was 5&frac12; inches. The largest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
of the phalanges which may be classed as second or
third is 8&frac12; inches, and that, I suppose, may have been
associated with the 7&frac34; inches first phalange. But
the other bones which could have had this position
all measure 5&frac12; and 7&frac34; inches. The three species
indicated by finger bones may have had the measurements:&mdash;</p>

<p>The femur is represented by many examples&mdash;one
3&frac34; inches long, and others less than 3 inches long
(2<sup>9</sup>/<sub>10</sub>). In Campylognathus, which has so much in
common with the jaw and the wing bones in size,
the upper leg bone is 2<sup>8</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inches. Therefore if we
assign the larger femur to the larger wing, the femur
will be relatively longer in all species of Rhamphocephalus
than in Campylognathus. Only one example
of a tibia is preserved. It is 3&frac12; inches long,
or only <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inch shorter than the bone in Campylognathus,
which has the femur 2<sup>8</sup>/<sub>10</sub> inches, so that I
refer the tibia of Rhamphocephalus to the species
which has the intermediate length of wing. These
coincidences with Campylognathus establish a close
affinity, and may raise the question whether the
Upper Lias species may not be included in the
Stonesfield Slate genus Rhamphocephalus.</p>

<p>The late Professor Phillips, in his <i>Geology of Oxford</i>,
attempted a restoration of the Stonesfield Ornithosaur,
and produced a picturesque effect (<a href="#Page_164">p. 164</a>); but
no restoration is possible without such attention to
the proportions of the bones as we have indicated.</p>

<h4>OXFORD CLAY</h4>

<p>A few bones of flying reptiles have been found in
the Lower Oxford Clay near Peterborough, and others
in the Upper Oxford Clay at St. Ives, in Huntingdonshire.
A single tail vertebra from the Middle Oxford
Clay, near Oxford, long since came under my own
notice, and shows that these animals belong to a
long-tailed type like Campylognathus. The cervical
vertebr&aelig; are remarkable for being scarcely longer than
the dorsal vertebr&aelig;; and the dorsal are at least half
as long again as is usual, having rather the proportion
of bones in the back of a crocodile.</p>


<h4>LITHOGRAPHIC SLATE</h4>

<p>Long-tailed Pterodactyles are beautifully preserved
in the Lithographic Limestone of the south of Bavaria,
at Solenhofen, and the quarries in its neighbourhood,
often with the skeleton or a large part of it flattened
out in the plane of bedding of the rock. Fine skeletons
are preserved in the superb museum at Munich,
at Heidelberg, Bonn, Haarlem, and London, and are
all referred to the genus Rhamphorhynchus or to
Scaphognathus. It is a type with powerfully developed
wings and a long, stiff tail, very similar to
that of Dimorphodon, so that some naturalists refer
both to the same family. There is some resemblance.</p>

<p>The type which is most like Dimorphodon is the
celebrated fossil at Bonn, sometimes called <i>Pterodactylus
crassirostris</i>, which in a restored form, with a
short tail, has been reproduced in many text-books.
No tail is preserved in the slab, and I ventured to
give the animal a tail for the first time in a restoration
(<a href="#Page_163">p. 163</a>) published by the <i>Illustrated London News</i>
in 1875, which accompanied a report of a Royal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Institution lecture. Afterwards, in 1882, Professor
Zittel, of Munich, published the same conclusion.
The reason for restoring the tail was that the animal
had the head constructed in the same way as
Pterodactyles with a long tail, and showed differences
from types in which the tail is short; and there
is no known short-tailed Pterodactyle, with wrist
and hand bones, such as characterise this animal.
The side of the face has a general resemblance to
the Pterodactyles from the Lias, for although the
framework is firmer, the four apertures in the head
are similarly placed. The nostril is rather small and
elongated, and ascends over the larger antorbital
vacuity. The orbit for the eye is the largest opening
in the head, so that these three apertures successively
increase in size, and are followed by the vertically
elongated post-orbital vacuity. The teeth are widely
spaced apart, and those in the skull extend some
distance backward to the end of the maxillary bone.
There are few teeth in the lower jaw, and they correspond
to the large anterior teeth of Dimorphodon,
there being no teeth behind the nasal opening. The
lower jaw is straight, and the extremities of the
jaws met when the mouth was closed. The breast
bone does not show the keel which is so remarkable
in Rhamphorhynchus, which may be attributed to
its under side being exposed, so as to exhibit the
pneumatic foramina.</p>

<p>The ribs have double heads, more like those of a
Crocodile in the region of the back than is the case
with the bird-like ribs from Stonesfield. The second
joint in the wing finger may be longer than the first&mdash;a
character which would tend to the association of
this Pterodactyle with species from the Lias; a relation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
to which attention was first drawn by Mr. E. T. Newton,
who described the Whitby skull.</p>

<p>The Pterodactyles from the Solenhofen Slate which
possess long tails have a series of characters which show
affinity with the other long-tailed types. The jaws are
much more slender. The orbit of the eye in Rhamphorhynchus
is enormously large, and placed vertically
above the articulation for the lower jaw. Immediately
in front of the eye are two small and elongated openings,
the hinder of which, known as the antorbital
vacuity, is often slightly smaller than the nostril, which
is placed in the middle length of the head, or a little
further back, giving a long dagger-shaped jaw, which
terminates in a toothless spear. The lower jaw has
a corresponding sharp extremity. The teeth are
directed forward in a way that is quite exceptional.
Notwithstanding the massiveness and elongation of
the neck vertebr&aelig;, which are nearly twice as long as
those of the back, the neck is sometimes only about
half the length of the skull.</p>

<p>All these long-tailed species from the Lithographic
Stone agree in having the sternum broad, with a long
strong keel, extending far forward. The coracoid
bones extend outward like those of a Crocodile, so
as to widen the chest cavity instead of being carried
forward as the bones are in Birds. These bones in this
animal were attached to the anterior extremity of the
sternum, so that the keel extended in advance of the
articulation as in other Pterodactyles. The breadth
of the sternum shows that, as in Mammals, the fore
part of the body must have been fully twice the
width of the region of the hip-girdle, where the
slenderer hind limbs were attached. The length
of the fore limb was enormous, for although the head
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
suggests an immense length relatively to the body,
nearly equal to neck and back together, the head is
not more than a third of the length of the wing
bones. The wing bones are remarkable for the short
powerful humerus with an expanded radial crest,
which is fully equal in width to half the length of the
bone. Another character is the extreme shortness
of the metacarpus, usually associated with immense
strength of the wing metacarpal bone.</p>

<p>The hind limbs are relatively small and relatively
short. The femur is usually shorter than the humerus,
and the tibia is much shorter than the ulna. The
bones of the instep, instead of being held together
firmly as in the Lias genera, diverge from each other,
widening out, though it often happens that four of
the five metatarsals differ but little in length. The
fifth digit is always shorter.</p>

<p>The hip-girdle of bones differs chiefly from other
types in the way in which those bones, which have
sometimes been likened to the marsupial bones, are
conditioned. They may be a pair of triangular bones
which meet in the middle line, so that there is an
outer angle like the arm of a capital Y. Sometimes
these triangular bones are blended into a curved,
bow-shaped arch, which in several specimens appears
to extend forward from near the place of articulation
of the femur. This is seen in fossil skeletons at
Heidelberg and Munich. It is possible that this
position is an accident of preservation, and that the
prepubic bones are really attached to the lower
border of the pubic bones.</p>

<p>Immense as the length of the tail appears to be,
exceeding the skull and remainder of the vertebral
column, it falls far short of the combined length of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
phalanges of the wing finger. The power of flight
was manifestly greater in Rhamphorhynchus than in
other members of the group, and all the modifications
of the skeleton tend towards adaptation of the
animals for flying. The most remarkable modification
of structure at the extremity of the tail was made
known by Professor Marsh in a vertical, leaf-like
expansion in this genus, which had not previously
been observed (<a href="#Page_161">p. 161</a>). The vertebr&aelig; go on steadily
diminishing in length in the usual way, and then
the ossified structures which bordered the tail bones
and run parallel with the vertebr&aelig; in all the Rhamphorhynchus
family, suddenly diverge downward and
upward at right angles to the vertebr&aelig;, forming a
vertical crest above and a corresponding keel below;
and between these structures, which are identified
with the neural spines and chevron bones of ordinary
vertebr&aelig;, the membrane extends, giving the extremity
of the tail a rudder-like feature, which, from knowledge
of the construction of the tail of a child's kite,
may well be thought to have had influence in directing
and steadying the animal's movements. There
are many minor features in the shoulder-girdle, which
show that the coracoid, for example, was becoming
unlike that bone in the Lias, though it still continues
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
to have a bony union with the elongated shoulder-blade
of the back.</p>

<p>The great German delineator of these animals, Von
Meyer, admitted six different species. Mr. Newton
and Mr. Lydekker diminish the number to four. It is
not easy to determine these differences, or to say how
far the differences observed in the bones characterise
species or genera. It is certain that there is one
remarkable difference from other and older Pterodactyles,
in that the last or fourth bone in the wing
finger is usually slightly longer than the third bone,
which precedes it. There is a certain variability in
the specimens which makes discussion of their
characters difficult, and has led to some forms being
regarded as varieties, while others, of which less
material is available, are classed as species. I am
disposed to say that some of the confusion may
have resulted from specimens being wrongly named.
Thus, there is a Rhamphorhynchus called curtimanus,
or the form with the short hand. It is
represented by two types. One of these appears to
have the humerus short, the ulna and radius long,
and the finger bones long; the other has the humerus
longer, the ulna much shorter, and the finger bones
shorter. They are clearly different species, but the
second variety agrees in almost every detail with
a species named hirundinaceus, the swallow-like
Rhamphorhynchus. This identification shows, not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
that the latter is a bad species, but that curtimanus
is a distinct species which had sometimes been confounded
with the other. While most of these
specimens show a small but steady decrease in the
length of the several wing finger bones, the species
called Gemmingi has the first three bones absolutely
equal and shorter than in the species curtimanus,
longimanus, or hirundinaceus. In the same way,
on the evidence of facts, I find myself unable to join
in discarding Professor Marsh's species phyllurus,
on account of the different proportions of its limb
bones. The humerus, metacarpus, and third phalange
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
of the wing finger in <i>Rhamphorhynchus phyllurus</i>
are exceptionally short as compared with other
species. Everyone agrees that the species called
longicaudus is a distinct one, so that it is chiefly in
slight differences in the proportions of constituent
parts of the skeleton that the types of the Rhamphorhynchus
are distinguished from each other.
I cannot quite concur with either Professor Zittel
(<a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58, 3</a>) or Professor Marsh (<a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58, 2</a>) in the
expansion which they give to the wing membrane
in their restorations; for although Professor Zittel
represents the tail as free from the hind legs, while
Professor Marsh connects them together, they both
concur in carrying the wing membrane from the
tip of the wing finger down to the extremity of the
ankle joint. I should have preferred to carry it no
further down the body than the lower part of the
back, there being no fossil evidence in favour of this
extension so far as specimens have been described.
Neither the membranous wings figured by Zittel nor
by Marsh would warrant so much body membrane as
the Rhamphorhynchus has been credited with. I
have based my restoration (<a href="#Page_161">p. 161</a>) of the skeleton
chiefly on <i>Rhamphorhynchus phyllurus.</i></p>

<h4>THE SHORT-TAILED TYPES</h4>

<p>The Pterodactylia are less variable; and the variation
among the species is chiefly confined to relative
length of the head, length of the neck, and the
height of the body above the ground. The tail is
always so short as to be inappreciable. Many of the
specimens are fragmentary, and the characters of the
group are not easily determined without careful
comparisons and measurements. The bones of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
fore limb and wing finger are less stout than in
the Rhamphorhynchus type, while the femur is
generally a little longer than the humerus, and the
wing finger is short in comparison with its condition
in Rhamphorhynchus. These short-tailed Pterodactyles
give the impression of being active little
animals, having very much the aspect of birds, upon
four legs or two. The neck is about as long as the
lower jaw, the antorbital vacuity in the head is imperfectly
separated from the much larger nasal opening,
the orbit of the eye is large and far back, the
teeth are entirely in front of the nasal aperture, and
the post-orbital vacuity is minute and inconspicuous.
The sternum is much wider than long, and no specimens
give evidence of a manubrium. The finger
bones progressively decrease in length. The prepubic
bones have a partially expanded fan-like form,
and never show the triradiate shape, and are never
anchylosed. About fifteen different kinds of Pterodactyles
have been described from the Solenhofen
Slate, mostly referred to the genus Pterodactylus,
which comprises forms with a large head and long
snout. Some have been placed in a genus (Ornithocephalus,
or Ptenodracon) in which the head
is relatively short. The majority of the species
are relatively small. The skull in <i>Ornithocephalus
brevirostris</i> is only 1 inch long, and the animal
could not have stood more than 1&frac12; inches to its back
standing on all fours, and but little over 2&frac12; inches
standing as a biped, on the hind limbs.</p>

<p>A restoration of the species called <i>Pterodactylus
scolopaciceps</i>, published in 1875 in the <i>Illustrated
London News</i> in the position of a quadruped, shows
an animal a little larger, with a body 2&frac12; inches high
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
and 6 to 7 inches long, with the wing finger 4&frac12; inches
long. Larger animals occur in the same deposit, and
in one named <i>Pterodactylus grandis</i> the leg bones
are a foot long; and such an animal may have been
nearly a foot in height to its back, standing as a
quadruped, though most of these animals had the
neck flexible and capable of being raised like the
neck of a Goose or a Deer (<a href="#Page_30">p. 30</a>), and bent down
like a Duck's when feeding.</p>

<img src="images/i_194.jpg" width="877" height="768" alt="FIG. 59." title="FIG. 59." />
</div>


<p>The type of the genus Pterodactylus is the form
originally described by Cuvier as<i> Pterodactylus longirostris</i>
(<a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>). It is also known as <i>P. antiquus</i>, that
name having been given by a German naturalist after
Cuvier had invented the genus, and before he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
named the species. There are some remarkable
features in which Cuvier's animal is distinct from
others which have been referred to the same
genus. Thus the head is 4&frac12; inches long, while
the entire length of the backbone to the extremity
of the tail is only 6&frac12; inches, and one
vertebra in the neck is at least as long as six in
the back, so that the animal has the greater part
of its length in the head and neck, although the
neck includes so few vertebr&aelig;. Nearly all the teeth&mdash;which
are few in number, short and broad, not
exceeding a dozen in either jaw&mdash;are limited to the
front part of the beak, and do not extend anywhere
near the nasal vacuity. This is not the case with all.</p>

<p>In the species named <i>P. Kochi</i>, which I have regarded
as the type of a distinct genus, there are
large teeth in the front of the jaw corresponding to
those of Pterodactylus, and behind these a smaller
series of teeth extending back under the nostril,
which approaches close to the orbit of the eye,
without any indication of a separate antorbital
vacuity. On those characters the genus Diopecephalus
was defined. It is closely allied to Pterodactylus;
both agree in having the ilium prolonged
forward more than twice as far as it is carried backward,
the anterior process covering about half a
dozen vertebr&aelig;, as in <i>Pterodactylus longirostris</i>. A
great many different types have been referred to
<i>Pterodactylus Kochi</i>, and it is probable that they
may eventually be distinguished from each other.
The species in which the upper borders of the orbits
approximate could be separated from those in which
the frontal interspace is wider.</p>

<p>It is a remarkable feature in these animals that
the middle bones of the foot, termed instep bones
or metatarsals, are usually close together, so that
the toes diverge from a narrow breadth, as in <i>P.
longirostris</i>, <i>P. Kochi</i>, and other forms; but there
also appear to be splay-footed groups of Pterodactyles
like the species which have been named
<i>P. elegans</i> and <i>P. micronyx</i>, in which the metatarsus
widens out so that the bones of the toes do not
diverge, and that condition characterises the Ptenodracon
(<i>Pterodactylus brevirostris</i>), to which genus
these species may possibly be referred. Nearly all
who have studied these animals regard the singularly
short-nosed species <i>P. brevirostris</i> as forming a
separate genus. For that genus S&ouml;mmerring's descriptive
name Ornithocephalus, which he used for
Pterodactyles generally, might perhaps have been
retained. But the name Ptenodracon, suggested by
Mr. Lydekker, has been used for these types.</p>


<p>Some of the largest specimens preserved at Stuttgart
and T&uuml;bingen have been named <i>Pterodactylus
suevicus</i> and <i>P. Fraasii</i>. They do not approach the
species <i>P. grandis</i> in size, so far as can be judged
from the fragmentary remains figured by Von Meyer;
for what appears to be the third phalange of the
wing finger is 7&frac12; inches long, while in these species
it is less than half that length, indicating an enormous
development of wing, relatively to the length
of the hind limb, which would probably refer the
species to another genus. <i>Pterodactylus suevicus</i>
differs from the typical Pterodactyles in having a
rounded, flattened under surface to the lower jaw,
instead of the common condition of a sharp keel
in the region of the symphysis. The beak also seems
flattened and swan-like, and the teeth are limited to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the front of the jaw. There appear to be some
indications of small nostrils, which look upward like
the nostrils of Rhamphorhynchus, but this may be
a deceptive appearance, and the nostrils are large
lateral vacuities, which are in the position of antorbital
vacuities, so that there would appear to be
only two vacuities in the side of the head in these
animals. The distinctive character of the skeleton in
this genus is found in the extraordinary length
of the metacarpus and in the complete ossification
of the smaller metacarpal bones throughout their
length. The metacarpal bones are much longer than
the bones of the fore-arm, and about twice the length
of the humerus. The first wing phalange is much
longer than the others, which successively and rapidly
diminish in length, so that the third is half the length
of the first. There are differences in the pelvis; for
the anterior process of the ilium is very short, in comparison
with its length in the genus Pterodactylus.
And the long stalk of the prepubic bone with its great
hammer-headed expansion transversely in front gives
those bones a character unlike other genera, so that
Cycnorhamphus ranks as a good genus, easily distinguished
from Cuvier's type, in which the four bones
of the wing are more equal in length, and the last is
more than half the length of the first; while the
metacarpus in that genus is only a little longer than
the humerus, and much shorter than the ulna. The
<i>Pterodactylus suevicus</i> has the neck vertebr&aelig; flat on
the under side, and relatively short as compared
with the more slender and narrower vertebr&aelig; of
<i>P. Fraasii</i>.</p>

ORNITHOSAURS FROM THE UPPER
SECONDARY ROCKS</h2>


<p>When staying at Swanage, in Dorsetshire, many
years ago, I had the rare good fortune to obtain
from the Purbeck Beds the jaw of a Pterodactyle,
which had much in common in plan with the <i>Cycnorhamphus
Fraasii</i> from the Lithographic Slate, which
is preserved at Stuttgart. The tooth-bearing part of
this lower jaw is 8 inches long as preserved, extending
back 3 inches beyond the symphysis portion in which
the two sides are blended together. It is different
from Professor Fraas's specimen in having the teeth
carried much further back, and in the animal being
nearly twice as large. This fragment of the jaw is
little more than 1 foot long, which is probably less
than half its original length. A vertebra nearly
5 inches long, which is more than twice the length
of the longest neck bones in the Stuttgart fossil, is
the only indication of the vertebral column. Professor
Owen described a wing finger bone from these
Purbeck Beds, which is nearly 1 foot long. He terms
it the second of the finger. It may be the third, and
on the hypothesis that the animal had the proportions
of the Solenhofen fossil just referred to, the first wing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
finger bone of the English Purbeck Pterodactyle
would have exceeded 2 feet in length, and would
give a length for the wing finger of about 5 feet
3 inches. For this animal the name Doratorhynchus
was suggested, but at present I am unable to distinguish
it satisfactorily from Cycnorhamphus, which
it resembles in the forms both of the neck bones and
of the jaw. Very small Pterodactyles are also found
in the English Purbeck strata, but the remains are
few, and scattered, like these larger bones.</p>

</div>



<p>The Wealden strata being shallow, fresh-water
deposits might have been expected to supply better
knowledge of Pterodactyles than has hitherto been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
available. Jaws of Ornithocheirus sagittirostris have
been found in the beds at Hastings, and in other
parts of Sussex. Some fragments are as large as
anything known. The best-preserved remains have
come from the Isle of Wight, and were rewards to
the enthusiastic search of the Rev. W. Fox, of Brixton.
In the principal specimen the teeth were short and
wide, the head large and deep with large vacuities,
but the small brain case of that skull is bird-like.
The neck bones are 2&frac12; inches long. In the upper
part of the back the bones are united together by
anchylosis, so that they form a structure in the back
like a sacrum, which does not give attachment to the
scapula, as in some Pterodactyles from the Chalk, but
the bones are simply blended, as in the frigate-bird,
allied to Pelicans and Cormorants. And then after a
few free vertebr&aelig; in the lower part of the back, succeeds
the long sacrum, formed in the usual way, of many
vertebr&aelig;. I described a sacrum of this type from the
Wealden Beds, under the name <i>Ornithodesmus</i>, referable
to another species, which in many respects was
so like the sacrum of a Bird that I could not at the
time separate it from the bird type. This genus has
a sternum with a strong deep keel, and the articulation
for the coracoid bones placed at the back of the
keel in the usual way, but with a relation to each
other seen in no genus hitherto known, for the
articular surfaces are wedge-shaped instead of being
ovate; and instead of being side by side, they obliquely
overlap, practically as in wading birds like the
Heron. I have never seen any Pterodactyle teeth so
flattened and shaped like the end of a lancet; and
from this character the form was known between
Mr. Fox and his friends as "latidens." The name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Ornithodesmus is as descriptive of the sternum as of
the vertebral column. The wing bones, as far as
they are preserved, have the relatively great strength
in the fore limb which is found in many of the Pterodactyles
of the Cretaceous period, and are quite as
large as the largest from the Cambridge Greensand.
In the Sussex species named <i>P. sagittirostris</i> the
lower jaw articulation was inches wide.</p>

<p>A few Pterodactyles' bones have been discovered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
in the Neocomian sands of England and Germany,
and other larger bones occur in the Gault of Folkestone
and the north of France; but never in such
association as to throw light on the aspect of the
skeleton.</p>


<h4>ORNITHOCHEIRUS</h4>

<p>Within my own memory Pterodactyle remains
were equally rare from the Cambridge Greensand.
The late Professor Owen in one of his public lectures
produced the first few fragments received from
Cambridge, and with a knowledge which in its
scientific method seemed to border on the power of
creation, produced again the missing parts, so that
the bones told their story, which the work of waves
and mineral changes in the rock had partly obliterated.
Subsequently good fortune gave me the
opportunity during ten years to help my University
in the acquisition and arrangement of the finest
collection of remains of these animals in Europe.
Out of an area of a few acres, during a year or two,
came the thousand bones of Ornithosaurs, mostly
associated sets of remains, each a part of a separate
skeleton, described in my published catalogues, as
well as the best of those at York and in the British
Museum and other collections in London.</p>

<p>The deposit which yields them, named Cambridge
Greensand, may or may not represent a long period
of time in its single foot of thickness; but the abundance
of fossils, obtained whenever the workmen were
adequately remunerated for preserving them, would
suggest that the Pterodactyles might have lived
like sea-birds or in colonies like the Penguins, if
it were not that the number of examples of each
species found is always small, and the many variations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
of structure suggested rather that the individuals
represent the life of many lands. The collections of
remains are mostly from villages in the immediate
vicinity of Cambridge, such as Chesterton, Huntingdon
Road, Coldham Common, Haslingfield, Barton,
Shillington, Ditton, Granchester, Harston, Barrington,
stretching south to Ashwell in Bedfordshire on
the one hand, as well as further north by Horningsea
into the fens. Each appears to be the associated
bones of a single individual. The remains mostly
belong to comparatively large animals. Some were
small, though none have been found so diminutive
as the smallest from the Solenhofen Slate. The
largest specimens with long jaws appear to have
had the head measuring not more than eighteen
inches in length, which is less than half the size of
the great toothless Pterodactyles from Kansas.</p>

<p class="center">The parts left white are in the Geological Museum at Cambridge. The shaded
parts have not been found. The two holes are the eye and the nostril<br />
(From the Cambridge Greensand)</p>
</div>

<p>The Cambridge specimens manifestly belong to at
least three genera. Something may be said of the
characters of the large animals which are included in
the genus Ornithocheirus. These fossils have many
points of structure in common with the great
American toothless forms which are of similar geological
age. The skull is remarkable for having the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
back of the head prolonged in a compressed median
crest, which rose above the brain case, and extended
upward and over the neck vertebr&aelig;, so as to indicate
a muscular power not otherwise shown in the group.
For about three inches behind the brain this wedge
of bone rested on the vertebr&aelig;, and probably overlapped
the first three neural arches in the neck.</p>

<p>Another feature of some interest is the expansion
of the bone which comes below the eye. In Birds
this malar or cheek bone is a slender rod, but in
these Pterodactyles it is a vertical plate, which is
blended with the bone named the quadrate bone,
which makes the articulation with the lower jaw in
all oviparous animals.</p>

<p>The beak varies greatly in length and in form,
though it is never quite so pointed as in the American
genus, for there is always a little truncation in front,
when teeth are seen projecting forward from a position
somewhat above the palate; the snout is often
massive and sometimes club-shaped. Except for these
variations of shape in the compressed snout, which is
characterised by a ridge in the middle of the palate,
and a corresponding groove in the lower jaw, and
the teeth, there is little to distinguish what is known
of the skull in its largest English Greensand fossils
from the skull remains which abound in the Chalk
of Kansas.</p>

<p>This English genus Ornithocheirus, represented by
a great number of species, had the neural arch of
the neck bones expanded transversely over the body
of the vertebra in a way that characterises many
birds with powerful necks, and is seen in a few
Pterodactyles from Solenhofen.</p>

<p>It is difficult to resist the conclusion that the neck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
vertebr&aelig; were not usually more than twice to three
times as long as those of the back, and it would
appear that the caudal vertebr&aelig; in the English
Cretaceous types were comparatively large, and
about twice as long as the dorsal vertebr&aelig;. Unless
there has been a singular succession of accidents in
the association of these vertebr&aelig; with the other remains,
Ornithocheirus had a tail of moderate length,
formed of a few vertebr&aelig; as long as those of the
neck, though more slender, quite unlike the tail in
either the long-tailed or short-tailed groups of Solenhofen
Pterodactyles, and longer than in the toothless
Pterodactyles of America.</p>

<img src="images/i_214.jpg" width="640" height="370" alt="FIG. 70." title="FIG. 70." />
</div>

<p>The singular articulation for the humerus at the
truncated extremity of the coracoid bone is a
character of this group, as is the articulation of the
scapul&aelig; with the neural arches of the dorsal vertebr&aelig;,
at right angles to them (<a href="#Page_115">p. 115</a>), instead of running
over the ribs as in Birds and as in other Pterodactyles.</p>

<p>The smaller Pterodactyles have their jaws less compressed
from side to side. The upper arm bone, the
humerus, instead of being truncated at its lower end
as in Ornithocheirus, is divided into two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
rounded articular surfaces. That for the radius, the
bone which carries the wrist, is a distinct and oblique
rounded facet, while the ulna has a rounded and
pulley-like articulation on which the hand may rotate.
These differences are probably associated with an
absence of the remarkable mode of union of the
scapul&aelig; with the dorsal vertebr&aelig;. But I have
hesitated to give different names to these smaller
genera because no example of scapula has come
under my notice which is not truncated at the free
end. I do not think this European type can be
the Nyctodactylus of Professor Marsh, in which
sutures appear to be persistent between the bodies
of the vertebr&aelig; and their arches, because no examples
have been found at Cambridge with the neural arches
separated, although the scapula is frequently separated
from the coracoid in large animals.</p>

<h4>ORNITHOSTOMA</h4>

<p>The most interesting of all the English Pterodactyle
remains is the small fragment of jaw figured by
Sir Richard Owen in 1859, which is a little more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
two inches long and an inch wide, distinguished by a
concave palate with smooth rounded margins to the
jaws and a rounded ridge to the beak. It is the only
satisfactory fragment of the animal which has been
figured, and indicates a genus of toothless Pterodactyles,
for which the name Ornithostoma was first used
in 1871. After some years Professor Marsh found
toothless Pterodactyles in Kansas, and indicated
several species. There are remains to the number of
six hundred specimens of these American animals in
the Yale Museum alone; but very little was known of
them till Professor Williston, of Lawrence, in Kansas,
described the specimens from the Kansas University
Museum, when it became evident that the bones of
the skeleton are mostly formed on the same plan
as those of the Cambridge Greensand genus, Ornithocheirus.
They are not quite identical. Professor
Williston adopts for them the name Ornithostoma,
in preference to Pteranodon which Marsh had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
suggested. Both animals have the dagger-shaped form
of jaw, with corresponding height and breadth of the
palate. The same flattened sides to the snout, converging
upwards to a rounded ridge, the same compressed
rounded margin to the jaw, which represents
the border in which teeth are usually implanted, and
in both the palate has the same smooth character
forming a single wide concave channel. Years previously
I had the pleasure of showing to Professor
Marsh the remarkable characters of the jaw, shoulder-girdle
bones, and scapul&aelig; in the Greensand Pterodactyles
while the American fossils were still undiscovered.
I subsequently made the restoration of the
shoulder-girdle (<a href="#Page_115">p. 115</a>). Professor Williston states to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
me that the shoulder-girdle bones in American examples
of Ornithostoma have a close resemblance to
those of Ornithocheirus figured in 1891, as is evident
from remains now shown in the British Museum. It
appears that the Kansas bones are almost invariably
crushed flat, so that their articular ends are distorted.
The neck vertebr&aelig; are relatively stout as in Ornithocheirus.
The hip-girdle of the American Ornithostoma
can be closely paralleled in some English
specimens of Ornithocheirus, though each prepubic
bone is triangular in the American fossils as in
<i>P. rhamphastinus</i>. They are united into a transverse
bar as in Rhamphorhynchus, unknown in the English
fossils. The femur has the same shape as in Ornithocheirus;
and the long tibia terminates in a pulley.
There is no fibula. The sternum in both has a
manubrium, or thick keel mass, prolonged in front
of its articular facets for the coracoid bones, which
are well separated from each other. Four ribs
articulate with its straight sides. The animal has
four toes and the fifth is rudimentary; there are no
claws to the first and second.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>In
the restoration which Professor Williston has
made the wing metacarpal is long, and in the shortest
specimen measures 1 foot 7 inches, and in the longest
1 foot 8 inches. This is exactly equal to the length
of the first phalange of the wing finger. The second
wing finger bone is 3 inches shorter, the third is little
more than half the length of the first, while the fourth
is only 6&frac34; inches long, showing a rapid shortening of
the bones, a condition which may have characterised
all the Cretaceous Pterodactyles. The short
humerus, about 1 foot long, and the fore-arm, which
is scarcely longer, are also characteristic proportions
of Ornithostoma or Pteranodon, as known from the
American specimens. Professor Williston gives no
details of the remarkable tail, beyond saying that the
tail is small and short, and that the vertebr&aelig; are flat
at the ends, without transverse processes. In the restoration
the tail is shorter than in the short-tailed
species from the Lithographic Slate, and unlike the
tail in Ornithocheirus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the succession of Pterodactyles in geological
time. Their history is like that of the human
race. In the most ancient nations man's life comes
upon us already fully organised. The Pterodactyles
begin, so far as isolated bones are concerned, in the
Rh&aelig;tic strata; perhaps in the Muschelkalk or middle
division of the Trias. And from the beginning
of the Secondary time they live on with but little
diversity in important and characteristic structures,
and so far as habit goes, the great Pterodactyles
of the Upper Chalk of England cannot be said to
be more highly organised than the earlier stiff-tailed
genera of the Lias or the Oolites. There is nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
like evolution. No modification such as that which
derives the one-toed horse or the two-toed ox from
ancestors with a larger number of digits. On the
other hand, there is little, if any, evidence of degeneration.
The later Pterodactyles do not appear
to have lost much, although the tail in some of the
Solenhofen genera may be degenerate when compared
with the long tail of Dimorphodon; but the
short-tailed types are found side by side with the
long-tailed Rhamphorhynchus. The absence of teeth
may be regarded as degeneration, for they have
presumably become lost, in the same way that Birds
now existing have lost the teeth which characterised
the fossil birds&mdash;Ichthyornis of the American Greensand,
and Arch&aelig;opteryx of the Upper Oolites of
Bavaria. But just as some of the earlier Pterodactyles
have no teeth at the extremity of the jaw, such
as Dorygnathus and Rhamphorhynchus, so the loss
of teeth may have extended backward till the jaws
became toothless. The specimens hitherto known
give no evidence of such a change being in progress.
But just as the division of Mammals termed Edentata
usually wants only the teeth which characterise the
front of the jaw, yet others, like the Great Ant-eater
of South America named Myrmecophaga, have the
jaws as free from teeth as the toothless Pterodactyles
or living Birds, and show that in that order the teeth
have no value in separating these animals into subordinate
groups any more than they have among the
Monotremata, where one type has teeth and the other
is toothless.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

CLASSIFICATION OF THE
ORNITHOSAURIA</h2>


<p>When an attempt is made to determine the
place in nature of an extinct group of animals
and the relation to each other of the different types
included within its limits, so as to express those facts
in a classification, attention is directed in the first
place to characters which are constant, and persist
through the whole of its constituent genera. We
endeavour to find the structural parts of the skeleton
which are not affected by variation in the dentition,
or the proportions of the extremities, or length of
the tail, which may define families or genera, or
species.</p>

<p>It has already been shown that while in many
ways the Ornithosaurian animals are like Birds, they
have also important resemblances to Reptiles. They
are often named Pterosauria. The wing finger gives
a distinctive character which is found in neither one
class of existing animals nor the other, and is common
to all the Pterodactyles at present known. They have
been named Ornithosauria as a distinct minor division
of back-boned animals, which may be regarded as
neither Reptiles nor Birds in the sense in which those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
terms are used to define a Lizard or Ostrich among
animals which still exist. It is not so much that they
mark a transition from Reptile to Bird, as that they
are a group which is parallel to Birds, and more
manifestly holds an intermediate place than Birds do
between Reptiles and Mammals. In plan of structure
Bird and Reptile have more in common than was
at one time suspected. The late Professor Huxley
went so far as to generalise on those coincidences
in parts of the skeleton, and united Birds and Reptiles
into one group, which he named Sauropsida, to express
the coincidences of structure between the Lizard
and the Bird tribes. The idea is of more value than
the term in which it is expressed, because Reptiles
are not, as we have seen, a group of animals which
can be defined by any set of characters as comprehensive
as those which express the distinctive features
of Birds. From the anatomist's point of view Birds
are a smaller group, and while some Reptiles have
affinity with them, it is rather the extinct than the
living groups which indicate that relation. Other
Reptiles have affinities of a more marked kind with
Mammals, and there are points in the Ornithosaurian
skeleton which are distinctly Mammalian. So that
when the Monotreme Mammals are united with
South African reptiles known as Theriodontia, which
resemble them, in a group termed Theropsida to
express their mammalian resemblances, it is evident
that there is no one continuous chain of life or gradation
in complexity of structure of animals.</p>

<p>We have to determine whether the Ornithosauria incline
towards the Sauropsidan or Bird-Reptile alliance,
or to the Mammal-Reptile or Theropsidan alliance.
There can be no doubt that the predominant ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>dency
is to the former, with a minor affinity towards
the latter.</p>

<p>The Ornithosauria are one of a series of groups
of animals, living and extinct, which have been
combined in an alliance named the Ornithomorpha.
That group includes at least five great divisions
of animals, which circle about birds, known as
Ornithosauria, Crocodilia, Saurischia, Aves, Ornithischia,
and Aristosuchia. Their relations to each other
are not evident in an enumeration, but may be shown
in some degree in a diagram (see <a href="#Page_190">p. 190</a>).</p>


<h4>THE ORNITHOMORPHA</h4>

<p>The Ornithomorpha arranged in this way show
that the three middle groups&mdash;carnivorous Saurischia,
Aristosuchia, herbivorous Ornithischia&mdash;which are
usually united as Dinosauria, intervene between
Birds and Ornithosaurs; and that the Crocodilia
and Ornithosauria are parallel groups which are connected
with Birds, by the group of Dinosaurs, which
resembles Birds most closely.</p>

<p>The Ornithomorpha is only one of a series of large
natural groups of animals into which living and
extinct terrestrial vertebrata may be arranged. And
the succeeding diagram may contribute to make
evident the relations of Ornithosauria to the other
terrestrial vertebrata (see <a href="#Page_191">p. 191</a>).</p>

<p>Herein it is seen that while the Ornithomorpha
approach towards Mammalia through the Ornithosauria,
and less distinctly through the Crocodilia,
they approach more directly to the Sauromorpha,
through the Plesiosaurs and Hatteria; while
that group also approaches more directly to the
Mammals through the Plesiosaurs and Anomodonts.</p>

the classification of animals.</p>

<p>Turning to the Pterodactyles themselves, Von
Meyer divided them naturally into short-tailed and
long-tailed. The short-tailed indicated by the name
Pterodactylus he further divided into long-nosed and
short-nosed. The short-nosed genus has since been
named Ptenodracon (<a href="#Fig_59">Fig. 59, p. 167</a>). The long-tailed
group was divided into two types&mdash;the Rhamphorhynchus
of the Solenhofen Slate (<a href="#Fig_56">Fig. 56, p. 161</a>)
and the English form now known as Dimorphodon
(<a href="#Fig_52">Fig. 52, p. 150</a>), which had been described from the
Lias.</p>

<p>The Cretaceous Pterodactyles form a distinct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
family. So that, believing the tail to have been short
in that group (<a href="#Fig_58">Fig. 58</a>), there are two long-tailed as
well as two short-tailed families, which were defined
from their typical genera Pterodactylus, Ornithocheirus,
Rhamphorhynchus, and Dimorphodon.</p>

<p>The differences in structure which these animals
present are, first: the big-headed forms from the Lias
like Dimorphodon, agree with the Rhamphorhynchus
type from Solenhofen in having a vacuity in the skull
defined by bone, placed between the orbit of the eye
and the nostril. With those characters are correlated
the comparatively short bones which correspond to
the back of the hand termed metacarpals, and the
tail is long, and stiffened down its length with ossified
tendons. These characters separate Ornithosaurs
with long tails from those with short tails.</p>

<p>The short-tailed types represented by Pterodactylus
and Ornithocheirus have no distinct antorbital vacuity
in the skull defined by bone. The metacarpal bones
of the middle hand are exceptionally elongated, and
the tail, which was flexible in both, appears to have
been short. These differences in the skeleton warrant
a primary division of flying reptiles into two principal
groups.</p>

<p>The short-tailed group, which was recognised by
De Blainville as intermediate between Birds and
Reptiles, may take the name Pterodactylia, which
he suggested as a convenient, distinctive name. It
may probably be inconvenient to enlarge its significance
to comprise not only the true Pterodactyles
originally defined as Pterosauria, but the newer
Ornithostoma and Ornithocheirus which have been
grouped as Ornithocheiroidea.</p>

<p>The second order, in which the wing membrane<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
appears to have had a much greater extent, in being
carried down the hind limbs, where the outermost
digit and metatarsal are modified for its support, has
been named Pterodermata, to include the types
which are arranged around Rhamphorhynchus and
Dimorphodon.</p>

<p>Both these principal groups admit of subdivision
by many characters in the skeleton, the most remarkable
of which is afforded by the pair of bones carried
in front of the pubes, and termed prepubic bones.
In the Pterodactyle family the bones in front of the
pubes are always separate from each other, always
directed forward, and have a peculiar fan-shaped
form with concave sides like the bone which holds a
similar position in a Crocodile. In the Ornithocheirus
family the prepubic bones appear to have been originally
triangular, but were afterwards united so as
to form a strong continuous bar which extends transversely
across the abdomen in advance of the pubic
bones. This at least is the distinctive character in the
genus Ornithostoma according to Professor Williston,
which in many ways closely resembles Ornithocheirus.</p>

<p>The two families in the long-tailed order named
Pterodermata are separated from each other by a
similar difference in their prepubic bones. In Dimorphodon
those bones are separate from each other,
and remain distinct through life, meeting in the
middle line of the body in a wide plate. On the
other hand, in Rhamphorhynchus the prepubic bones,
which are at first triangular and always slender,
become blended together into a slight transverse bar,
which only differs from that attributed to Ornithostoma
in its more slender bow-shaped form.</p>



<p>Thus if other characters of the skeleton are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
ignored and a classification based upon the structure of
the pelvis and prepubic bones, there would be some
ground for associating the long-tailed Rhamphorhynchus
from the Upper Oolites which is losing the
teeth in the front of its jaw with the Cretaceous Ornithostoma,
which has the teeth completely wanting;
while the long-tailed Dimorphodon would come into
closer association with the short-tailed Pterodactylus.
The drum-stick bone or tibia in Dimorphodon, with
its slender fibula, like that of a Bird, also resembles
a Bird in the rounded and pulley-shaped terminal
end which makes the joint corresponding to the
middle of the ankle bones in man. The same condition
of a terminal pulley joint is found in the
Cretaceous Pterodactyles. But in the true Pterodactyles
and in Rhamphorhynchus there usually is
no pulley-shaped termination to the lower end of
the drum-stick, for the tarsal bones remain separate
from each other, and form two rows of ossifications,
showing the same differences as separate Dinosaurs
into the divisions which have been referred to, from
their Bird-like pelvis and tibio-tarsus, as Ornithischia
in the one case, and Saurischia in the other from
their bones being more like those of living Lizards.</p>

FAMILY RELATIONS OF PTERODACTYLES
TO ANIMALS WHICH
LIVED WITH THEM</h2>


<p>Enough has been said of the general structure
of Pterodactyles and the chief forms which
they assumed while the Secondary rocks were accumulating,
to convey a clear idea of their relations
to the types of vertebrate animals which still survive
on the earth. We may be unable to explain the
reasons for their existence, and for their departure
from the plan of organisation of Reptiles and Birds.
But the evidence has not been exhausted which may
elucidate their existence. Sometimes, in problems of
this kind, which involve comparison of the details of
the skeleton in different animals, it is convenient to
imagine the possibility of changes and transitions
which are not yet supported by the discovery of
fossil remains. If, for example, the Pterodactyle be
conceived of as divested of the wing finger, which is
its most distinctive character, or that finger is supposed
to be replaced by an ordinary digit, like the three-clawed
digits of the hand which we have regarded
as applied to the ground, where, it may be asked,
would the animal type be found which approximates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
most closely to a Pterodactyle which had been thus
modified? There are two possible replies to such a
question, suggested by the form of the foot. For
the old Bird Arch&aelig;opteryx has three such clawed
digits, but no wing finger. And some Dinosaurs also
have the hand with three digits terminating in claws,
which are quite comparable to the clawed digits of
Pterodactyles.</p>

<p>The truth expressed in the saying that no man by
taking thought can add a cubit to his stature is of
universal application in the animal world, in relation
to the result upon the skeleton of the exercise of a
function by the individual. Yet such is the relation
in proportions of the different parts of the animal to
the work which it performs, so marked is the evidence
that growth has extended in direct relation to use of
organs and active life, and that structures have become
dwarfed from overwork, or have wasted away from
disuse&mdash;seen throughout all vertebrate animals, that
we may fairly attribute to the wing finger some correlated
influence upon the proportions of the animal,
as a consequence of the dependence of the entire
economy upon each of its parts. Therefore if an
allied animal did not possess a wing finger, and did
not fly, it might not have developed the lightness of
bone, or the length of limb which Pterodactyles
possess.</p>

<p>The mere expansion of the parachute membrane
seen in so-called flying animals, both Mammals and
Reptiles, which are devoid of wings, is absolutely
without effect in modifying the skeleton. But when
in the Bat a wing structure is met with which may
be compared to a gigantic extension of the web foot
of the so-called Flying Frog, the bones of the fingers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and the back of the hand elongate and extend under
the stimulus of the function of flight in the same
way as the legs elongate in the more active hoofed
animals, with the function of running. Therefore it
is not improbable that the limbs shared to some
extent in growth under stimulus of exercise which
developed the wing finger. And if an animal can be
found among fossils so far allied as to indicate a
possible representative of the race from which these
Flying Dragons arose, it might be expected to be at
least shorter legged, and possibly more distinctly
Reptilian in the bones of the shoulder-girdle which
support the muscles used in flight. It may readily
be understood that the kinds of life which were most
nearly allied to Pterodactyles are likely to have
existed upon the earth with them, and that flight was
only one of the modes of progression which became
developed in relation to their conditions of existence.
The principal assemblage of terrestrial animals
available for such comparison is the Dinosauria. They
may differ from Pterodactyles as widely as the Insectivora
among Mammals differ from Bats, but not
in a more marked way. Comparisons will show that
there are resemblances between the two extinct groups
which appeal to both reason and imagination.</p>

<p>Dinosaurs are conveniently divided by characters
of the pelvis first into the order Saurischia, which
includes the carnivorous Megalosaurus and the Cetiosaurus,
with the pelvis on the Reptile plan; and
secondly the order Ornithischia, represented by Iguanodon,
with the pelvis on the Bird plan. It may be
only a coincidence, but nevertheless an interesting
one, that the characters of those two great groups of
reptiles, which also extend throughout the Secondary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
rocks, are to some extent paralleled in parts of the
skeleton of the two divisions of Pterodactyles. This
may be illustrated by reference to the skull, pelvis,
hind limb, and the pneumatic condition of the bones.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 524px;">
<a name="Fig_77" id="Fig_77"></a>
<span class="caption">FIG. 77. &nbsp;  COMPARISON OF THE SKULL OF THE
DINOSAUR ANCHISAURUS WITH THE ORNITHOSAUR DIMORPHODON</span>
<img src="images/i_234.jpg" width="524" height="480" alt="FIG. 77." title="FIG. 77." />
</div>


<p>The Saurischian Dinosauria have an antorbital
vacuity in the side of the skull between the nasal
opening and the eye, as in the long-tailed Ornithosaurs
named Pterodermata. In some of the older
genera of these carnivorous Dinosaurs of the Trias,
the lateral vacuities of the head are as large as in
Dimorphodon. But in some at least of the Iguanodont,
or Ornithischian Dinosaurs, there is no antorbital
vacuity, and the side of the face in that
respect resembles the short-tailed Pterodactylia.
The skull of a carnivorous Dinosaur possesses teeth
which, though easily distinguished from those of
Pterodactyles, can be best compared with them. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
most striking difference is in the fact that in the
Dinosaur the nostrils are nearly terminal, while in
the Pterodactyle they are removed some distance
backward. This result is brought about by growth
taking place, in the one case at the front margin of
the maxillary bone so as to carry the nostril forward,
and in the other case at the back margin of the premaxillary
bone. Thus an elongated part of the jaw
is extended in front of the nostril. Hence there is
a different proportion between the premaxillary and
maxillary bones in the two groups of animals, which
corresponds to the presence of a beak in a bird, and
its absence in living reptiles. It is not known whether
the extremity of the Pterodactyle's beak is a single
bone, the intermaxillary bone, such as forms the
corresponding toothless part of the jaw in the South
African reptile Dicynodon, or whether it is made
by the pair of bones called premaxillaries which
form the extremity of the jaw in most Dinosaurs.
Too much importance may perhaps be attached
to such differences which are partly hypothetical,
because the extinct Ichthyosaurus, which has an exceptionally
long snout, has the two premaxillary
bones elongated so as to extend backward to the
nostrils. A similar elongation of those bones is seen
in Porpoises, which also have a long snout; and the
bones are carried back from the front of the head to
the nostrils, which are sometimes known as blowholes.
But the Porpoise has those premaxillary
bones not so much in advance of the bones which
carry teeth named maxillary, as placed in the interspace
between them. The nostrils, however, are not
limited to the extremity of the head in all Dinosaurs.
If this region of the beak in Dimorphodon be compared
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
with the corresponding part of a Dinosaur
from the Permian rocks, or Trias, the relation of the
nostril to the bones forming the beak may be better
understood.</p>

</div>

<p>In the sandstone of Elgin, usually named Trias, a
small Dinosaur is found, which has been named Ornithosuchus,
from the resemblance of its head to that
of a Bird. Seen from above, the head has a remarkable
resemblance to the condition in Rhamphorhynchus,
in the sharp-pointed beak and positions
of the orbits and other openings. In side view the
orbits have the triangular form seen in Dimorphodon,
and the preorbital vacuities are large, as in that genus,
while the lateral nostrils, which are smaller, are further
forward in the Dinosaur. The differences from Dimorphodon
are in the articulation for the jaw being
carried a little backward, instead of being vertical as
in the Pterodactyle, and the bone in front of the
nose is smaller. Notwithstanding probable differences<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
in the palate, the approximation, which extends to
the Crocodile-like vacuity in the lower jaw, is such
that by slight modification in the skull the differences
would be substantially obliterated by which the skull
of such an Ornithosaur is technically distinguished
from such a Dinosaur.</p>

<p>The back of the skull is clearly seen in the Whitby
Pterodactyle, and its structure is similar to the corresponding
part of such Dinosaurs as Anchisaurus or
Atlantosaurus, without the resemblance quite amounting
to identity, but still far closer than is the resemblance
between the same region in the heads of
Crocodiles, Lizards, Serpents, Chelonians. Few of
these fossil Dinosaur skulls are available for comparison,
and those differ among themselves. The
coincidences rather suggest a close collateral relation
than prove the elaboration of one type from the
other. They may have had a common ancestor.</p>

<p>The Trias rocks near Stuttgart have yielded Dinosaurs
as unlike Pterodactyles as could be imagined,
resembling heavily armoured Crocodiles, in such types
as the genus Belodon. Its jaws are compressed from
side to side, as in many Pterodactyles, and the nostrils
are at least as far backward as in Rhamphorhynchus.
Belodon has preorbital vacuities and postorbital vacuities,
but the orbit of the eye is never large, as in
Pterodactyles. It might not be worth while dwelling
on such points in the skull if it were not that the
pelvis in Belodon is a basin formed by the blending
of the expanded plates of the ischium and the pubis,
into a sheet of bone which more nearly resembles
the same region in Pterodactyles than does the
ischio-pubic region in other Dinosaurian animals
like Cetiosaurus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>The backbone in a few Dinosaurs is suggestive of
Pterodactyles. In such genera as have been named
C&#339;lurus and Calamospondylus, in which the skeleton
is only partially known, the neck vertebr&aelig; become
elongated, so as to compare with the long-necked
Pterodactyles. The cervical rib is often very similar
to that type, and blended with the vertebra, as in
Pterodactyles and Birds. The early dorsal vertebr&aelig;
of Pterodactyles might almost be mistaken for those
of Dinosaurs. The tail vertebr&aelig; of a Pterodactyle
are usually longer than in long-tailed Dinosauria.</p>

<p>In the limbs and the bony girdles which support
them there is more resemblance between Pterodactyles
and Dinosaurs than might have been anticipated,
considering their manifest differences in
habit. Thus all Dinosaurs have the hip bone named
ilium prolonged in front of the articulation for the
femur as well as behind it, almost exactly as in
Pterodactyles and Birds (see <a href="#Page_95">p. 95</a>). There is some
difference in the pubis and ischium which is more
conspicuous in form than in direction of the bones.
There is a Pterodactyle imperfectly preserved, named
<i>Pterodactylus dubius</i>, in which the ischium is directed
backward and the pubis downward, and the bones
unite below the acetabular cavity for the head of the
femur to work in, but do not appear to be otherwise
connected. In Rhamphorhynchus the connexion
between these two thickened bars is made by a thin
plate of bone. In such a Dinosaur as the American
carnivorous Ceratosaurus the two bars of the pubis
and ischium remain separate and diverging, and
there is no film of bone extending over the interspace
between them. The development of such a
bony condition would make a close approximation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
between the Ornithosaurian pelvis and that of those
Dinosaurs which closely resemble Pterodactyles in
skull and teeth.</p>

<p class="center">A Pterodactyle is shown between a carnivorous Dinosaur above and

</div>


<p>Another pelvic character of some interest is the
blending of the pubis and ischium of the right and
left sides in the middle line of the body. There are
some genera of Dinosaurs like the English Aristosuchus
from the Weald, and the American genera
C&#339;lurus, Ceratosaurus, and others, in which the
pubic bones, instead of uniting at their extremities,
are pinched together from side to side, and unite
down the lower part of their length, terminating
in an expanded end like a shoe, which is seen to be
a separate ossification, and probably formed by a pair
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
of ossifications joined in the median line. This small
bone, which is below the pubes, and in these animals
becomes blended with them, we may regard as a pair
of prepubic bones like those of Pterodactyles and
Crocodiles, except that they have lost the stalk-like
portions, which in those animals are developed to
compensate for the diminished length of the pubic
bones. The prepubic bones may also be developed
in Iguanodon, in which a pair of bones of similar
form remains throughout life in advance of the
pubes, as in Pterodactyles. In those Dinosauria
with the Bird-like type of pelvis the pubic bone
is exceptionally developed, sending one process
backward and another process forward, so that
there is a great gap between these diverging limbs
to the bone. In the region behind the sternum to
which the ribs were attached, and in front of the
pelvis, is a pair of bones in Iguanodon shaped like
the prepubic bones of Dimorphodon. They have
sometimes been interpreted as a hinder part of the
sternum, but may more probably be regarded as a
pair of prepubic bones articulating each with the
anterior process of the pubis (see <a href="#Fig_80">Fig. 80</a>). The small
bones found at the extremities of the pubes in such
carnivorous Dinosaurs as Aristosuchus are blended
by bony union with the pubes. The bones in Iguanodon
are placed behind the sternal region without
any attachment for sternal ribs, and the expanded
processes converge forwards from the stalk and unite
exactly like the prepubic bones of Ornithosaurs.
While this character, on the one hand, may link
Pterodactyles with the Dinosaurs, on the other hand
it may be a link between both those groups and the
Crocodiles, in which the front pair of bones of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
pelvis has also appeared to be representative of the
prepubic bones of Flying Reptiles (see <a href="#Fig_32">Fig. 32, p. 98</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The resemblances between Pterodactyles and Dinosaurs
in the hind limb are not of less interest, though
it is rather in the older Pterodactyles such as Dimorphodon,
Pterodactylus, and Rhamphorhynchus that
the resemblance is closest with the slender carnivorous
Dinosaurs. They never have the head of
the thigh bone, femur, separated from its shaft by a
constricted neck, as in the Pterodactyles from the
Chalk. In many ways the thigh bone of Dinosaurs
tends towards being Avian; while that of Pterodactyles
inclines towards being Mammalian, but with a
tendency to be Bird-like in the older types, and to be
Mammal-like in the most recent representatives of
the group in the Chalk.</p>

<p>The bones of the leg in Ornithosaurs, known as
tibia and fibula, are remarkable for the circumstance
first that they resemble Birds in the fibula being slender
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
and only developed in its upper part towards the
femur, and secondly that in a genus like Dimorphodon
this drum-stick bone has the two upper bones of
the ankle blended with the tibia, so as to form a
rounded pulley joint which is indistinguishable from
that of a Bird (see <a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>). There is a large number
of Dinosaurs in which this remarkable distinctive
character of Birds is also found. Only, Dinosaurs
like Iguanodon, for instance, have the slender fibula
as long as the tibia, and contributing to unite with the
separate ankle bones of the similarly rounded pulley
at the lower end. There are no Birds in which the
tarsal bones remain separated and distinct throughout
life. But in Pterodactylus from Solenhofen, as
in a number of Dinosaurs, especially the carnivorous
genera, the bones of the tarsus remain distinct throughout
life, and never acquired such forms as would have
enabled the ankle bone, termed astragalus, to embrace
the extremity of the tibia, as it does in Iguanodon.
Thus the resemblance of the Ornithosaur drum-stick
is almost as close to Dinosaurs as to Birds.</p>

<p>There is great similarity between Dinosaurs and
Pterodactyles seen in the region of the instep, known
as the metatarsus. These bones are usually four in
number, parallel to each other, and similar in form.
They are commonly longer than in Dinosaurs; but
among some of the carnivorous Dinosaurs their
length approximates to that seen in Pterodactyles.
In neither group are the bones blended together by
bony union, while they are always united in Birds, as
in Oxen and similar even-hoofed mammals. Dinosaurs
agree with Pterodactyles in maintaining the metatarsal
bones separate, but they differ from them and agree
with Birds frequently, in having the number of meta<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>tarsal
bones reduced to three, as in Iguanodon, though
Dinosaurs often have as many as five digits developed.</p>

<p>The toe bones, the phalanges of these digits of the
hind limb, are usually longer in Pterodactyles than in
Dinosaurs, but they resemble carnivorous Dinosaurs
in the forms of their sharp terminal bones for the claws,
which are similarly compressed from side to side.</p>

<p>So diverse are the functions of the fore limb in
Dinosaurs and Pterodactyles, and so remarkably does
the length of the metacarpal region of the back of the
hand vary in the long-tailed and short-tailed Ornithosaurs,
that there is necessarily a less close correspondence
in that region of the skeleton between these two
groups of animals; for the Pterodactyle fore limb is
modified in relation to a function which can only be
paralleled among Birds and Bats; and yet neither
of those groups of animals approximates closely in
this region of the skeleton to the Flying Reptile.
Under all the modifications of structure which may
be attributed to differences of function, some resemblance
to Dinosaurs may be detected, which is
best evident in the upper arm bone, humerus; is
slight in the fore-arm bones, ulna and radius; and
becomes lost towards the extremity of the limb.</p>

<p>If the tendency of the thigh bone to resemble a
Mammalian type of femur (<a href="#Page_100">p. 100</a>) is a fundamental,
deep-seated character of the skeleton, it might be anticipated
that a trace of Mammalian character would
also be found in the humerus. For what the character
is worth, the head of the humerus does show a closer
approximation to a Monotreme Mammal than is seen
in Birds, and is to some extent paralleled in those
South African reptiles which approximate to Mammals
most closely. Not the least remarkable of the many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
astonishing resemblances of these light aerial creatures
to the more heavy bodied Dinosaurs is the circumstance
that the humerus in both groups makes a not
dissimilar approach to that of certain Mammals.</p>

<p>These illustrations may be accepted as demonstrating
a relationship between the Ornithosaurs and
Dinosaurs now compared, which can only be explained
as results of influence of a common parentage
upon the forms of the bones. But more interesting
than resemblances of that kind is the similarity that
may be traced in the way in which air is introduced
into cavities in the bones in both groups. In some
of the imperfectly known Dinosaurs, like Aristosuchus,
C&#339;lurus, and Thecospondylus, the bone texture is as
thin as in Pterodactyles, and the vertebr&aelig; are excavated
by pneumatic cavities, which are amazing in
size when compared with the corresponding structures
in birds, for the vertebra is often hollowed out so that
nothing remains but a thin external film like paper
for its thickness. In the Dinosaurian genus C&#339;lurus
this condition is as well marked in the tail and back
as it is in the neck. The essential difference from
Birds appears to be that in the larger carnivorous
Dinosaurs the pneumatic condition of the bones is
confined to the vertebral column; while Birds and
Pterodactyles have the pneumatic condition more
conspicuously developed in the limb bones. The
pneumatic skeleton, however, appears to be absent
from the herbivorous types like Iguanodon and all
Dinosaurs which have the Bird-like form of pelvis,
and are most Bird-like in the forms of bones of the
hind limb. It is possible that some of the carnivorous
Dinosaurs also possessed limb bones with pneumatic
cavities. Many of those bones are hollow with very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
thin walls. If their cavities were connected with the
lungs the foramina are inconspicuous and unlike the
immense holes seen in the sides of the vertebr&aelig;.</p>

<p>According to the late Professor Marsh, the limbs
of C&#339;lurus and its allies, which at present are imperfectly
known, are in some cases pneumatic. Therefore
there is a closer fundamental resemblance between
some carnivorous Dinosaurs and Pterodactyles
than might have been anticipated. But the skull of
C&#339;lurus is unknown, and the fragments of the
skeleton hitherto published are insufficient to do
more than show that the two types were near in
kindred, though distinct in habit. Each has elaborated
a skeleton which owes much to the common
stock which transmitted the vital organs, and the tendency
of the bones to take special forms; but which
also owes more than can be accurately measured to
the action of muscles in shaping the bones and the
influence of the mechanical conditions of daily life
upon the growth of the bones in both of these orders
of animals. Enough is known to prove that all Dinosaurs
cannot be regarded as Ornithosaurs which have
not acquired the power of flight; though the evidence
would lead us to believe that the primitive Ornithosaur
was a four-footed animal, before the wing finger
became developed in the fore limb as a means of
extending a patagial membrane, like the membrane
which in the hind limb of Dimorphodon has bent the
outermost digit of the foot upward and outward to
support the corresponding organ of flight extending
down the hind legs.</p>

<p>It may thus be seen that the characters of Ornithosaurs
which have already been spoken of as Reptilian,
as distinguished from the resemblances to Birds, may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
now with more accuracy be regarded as Dinosaurian.
The Dinosaurs, like Pterodactyles, must be regarded
as intermediate in some respects between
Reptiles and Birds. The resemblances enumerated
would alone constitute a partial transition from the
Reptile to the Bird, although no Dinosaurs have
organs of flight; many are heavily armoured with
plates of bone, and few, if any, approximate in the
technical parts of the skeleton to the Bird class,
except in the hind limbs. Yet Dinosaurs have
sometimes been regarded as standing to Birds in
the relation of ancestors, or as parallel to an
ancestral stock.</p>

<p>Before an attempt can be made to estimate the
mutual relation of the Flying Reptiles to Dinosaurs
on the one hand, and to Birds on the other, it may
be well to remember that the resemblance of such
a Dinosaur as Iguanodon to a Bird in its pelvis and
hind limb is not more remarkable than that of
Pterodactyles to Birds in the shoulder-girdle and
bones of the fore limb. The keeled sternum, the
long, slender coracoid bones and scapul&aelig;, are absolutely
Bird-like in most Ornithosaurs; and that region
of the skeleton only differs from Birds in the absence
of a furculum which represents the clavicles, and is
commonly named the "merry-thought." The elongated
bones of the fore-arm and the hand, terminating
in three sharp claws, are characters in which the
fossil bird Arch&aelig;opteryx resembles the Pterodactyle
Rhamphorhynchus, a resemblance which extends to
a similar elongation of the tail. It is remarkable
that the resemblance should be so close, since Arch&aelig;opteryx
affords the only bird's skeleton known to be
contemporary which can be compared with the Solen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>hofen
Flying Reptiles. The resemblance may possibly
be closer than has been imagined. The back of the
head of Arch&aelig;opteryx is imperfectly preserved in
the region of the quadrate bone, malar arch, and
temporal vacuity. And till these are better known
it cannot be affirmed that the back of the head is
more Reptilian in Pterodactyles than in the oldest
Birds. The side of the head in Arch&aelig;opteryx is
distinguished by the nostril being far forward, the
vacuity in front of the orbit being as large as in
the Pterodactyle Scaphognathus from Solenhofen
and other long-tailed Pterodactyles.</p>

HOW PTERODACTYLES MAY
HAVE ORIGINATED</h2>


<p>Ornithosauria have many characters inseparably
blended together which are otherwise
distinctive of Reptiles, Birds, and Mammals, and associated
with peculiar structures which are absent
from all other animals. They are not quite alone in
this incongruous combination of different types of
animals in the same skeleton. Dinosaurs, which were
contemporary with Ornithosaurs, approximate to them
in blending characters of Birds with the structure of
a Reptile and something of a Mammal in one animal.
If an Ornithosaur is Reptilian in its backbone, in the
articular ends of each vertebra having the cup in
front and ball behind in the manner of Crocodiles,
Serpents, and many Lizards, a Dinosaur like Iguanodon,
which had the reversed condition of ball in
front and cup behind in its early vertebr&aelig;, may be
more Mammalian than Avian in a corresponding
resemblance of the bones to the neck in hoofed
Mammals. But while Pterodactyles are sometimes
Mammalian in having the head of the thigh bone
moulded as in carnivorous Mammals and Man, the
corresponding bone in a Dinosaur is more like that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
of a Bird. And while the Pterodactyle shoulder-girdle
is often absolutely Bird-like, that region in
Dinosaurs can only be paralleled among Reptiles.</p>

<p>Such combinations of diverse characters are not
limited to animals which are extinct. There were
not wanting scientific men who regarded the Platypus
of Australia, when first sent to Europe, as an
ingenious example of Eastern skill, in which an
animal had been compounded artificially by blending
the beak of a Bird with the body of a Mammal.
Fuller knowledge of that remarkable animal has
continuously intensified wonder at its combination
of Mammal, Bird, and Reptile in a single animal.
It has broken down the theoretical divisions between
the higher Vertebrata, demonstrating that a
Mammal may lay eggs like a Reptile or Bird, that
the skull may include the reptilian characters of the
malar arch and pre-frontal and post-frontal bones,
otherwise unknown in Mammals and Birds. The
groups of Mammals, Birds, and Reptiles now surviving
on the earth prove to be less sharply defined
from each other when the living and extinct types
are considered together. But in Pterodactyles,
Mammal Bird and Reptile lose their identity, as three
colours would do when unequally mixed together.</p>

<p>This mingling of characteristics of different animals
is not to be attributed to interbreeding, but is the
converse of the combination of characters found in
hybrid animals. It is no exaggeration to say that
there is a sense in which Mammal, Bird, Reptile, and
the distinctive structures of the Ornithosaur, have
simultaneously developed from one egg, in the body
of one animal.</p>

<p>The differences between those vertebrate types of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
animals consist chiefly in the way in which their
organisation is modified, by one strain of characters
being eliminated so that another becomes predominant,
while a distinctive set of structures is elaborated
in each class of animals. The earlier geological history
of the higher Vertebrata is very imperfectly
known, but the evidence tends to the inference that
the older representatives of the several classes approximate
to each other more closely than do their
surviving representatives, so that in still earlier ages
of time the distinction between them had not become
recognisable. The relation of the great groups of
animals to each other, among Vertebrata, is essentially
a parallel relation, like the colours of the solar spectrum,
or the parallel digits of the hand. It was
natural, when only the surviving life on the earth was
known, to imagine that animals were connected in a
continuous chain by successive descent, but Mammals
have given no evidence of approximation to Birds;
and Birds discover no evidence that their ancestors
were Reptiles, in the sense in which that word is used
to define animals which now exist on the earth.
When the variation which animals attain in their
maturity and exhibit in development from the egg
was first realised, it was imagined that Nature, by
slow summing up and accumulation of differences
which were observed, would so modify one animal
type that it would pass into another. There is little
evidence to support belief that the changes between
the types of life have been wrought in that way.
The history of fossil animals has not shown transitions
of this kind from the lower to higher Vertebrata,
but only intermediate, parallel groups of animals,
analogous to those which survive, and distinct from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
them in the same way as surviving groups are distinct
from each other. The circumstance that Mammals,
Birds, and Reptiles are all known low down in the
Secondary epoch of geological time, is favourable to
the idea of their history being parallel rather than
successive. Such a conception is supported by the
theory of elimination of characters from groups of
animals as the basis of their differentiation. This loss
appears always to be accompanied by a corresponding
gain of characters, which is more remarkable in
the soft, vital organs than in the skeleton. The gain
in higher Vertebrates in the bones is chiefly in the
perfection of joints at their extremities; but the gain
in brain, lungs, heart, and other soft parts is an
elaboration of those structures and an increase in
amount of tissue.</p>

<p>The resemblances of Ornithosaurs to Mammals are
the least conspicuous of their characters. Those seen
in the upper arm bone and thigh bone are manifestly
not derived from Mammals. They cannot be explained
as adaptations of the bones to conditions of
existence, because there is no community of habit to
be inferred between Pterodactyles and Mammals, in
which the bones are in any way comparable.</p>

<p>Other fossil animals show that a fundamentally
Reptilian structure is capable of developing in the
Mammalian direction in the skull, backbone, shoulder-girdle,
hip-girdle, and limbs, so as to be uniformly
Mammalian in its tendencies. This is proved by
tracing the North American Texas fossils named
Labyrinthodonts, through the South African Theriodonts,
towards the Monotremata and other Mammalia.
Just as those animals have obliterated all traces of
the Bird from their skeletons, Birds have obliterated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the distinctive characters of Mammals. The Ornithosaur
has partially obliterated both. With a skull and
backbone marked by typical characters of the Reptile,
it combines the shoulder-girdle and hip-girdle of a
Bird, with characters in the limbs which suggest both
those types in combination with Mammals.</p>

<p>The bones have been compared in the skeleton of
each order of existing Reptiles, and found to show
side by side with their peculiar characters not only
resemblances to the other Reptilia, but an appreciable
number of Mammalian and Avian characters in their
skeletons. The term "crocodile," for example, indicates
an animal in which the skeleton is dominated
by one set of peculiar characters. Crocodiles retain
enough of the characteristics of several other orders
of reptiles to show that an animal sprung from the
old Crocodile stock might diverge widely from existing
Crocodiles by intensifying what might be termed
its dormant characters in the Crocodile skeleton.
Comparing animals together bone by bone it is
possible to value the modifications of form which
they put on, and the resemblances between them,
so as to separate the inherited wealth of an animal's
affinities with ancestors or collateral groups, from
the peculiar characters which have been acquired
as an increase based upon its typical bony possessions
or osteological capital. There is no part of the Pterodactyle
skeleton which is more distinctly modified
than the head of the upper arm bone, which fits
into the socket between the coracoid bone and the
shoulder-blade. The head of the humerus, as the
articular part is named, is somewhat crescent-shaped,
convex on its inner border, and a little concave on
its outer border, and therefore unlike the ball-shaped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
head of the upper arm bone in Man and the higher
Mammals. It is much more nearly paralleled in the
little group of Monotremata allied to the living
Ornithorhynchus. In that sense the head of the
humerus in a Pterodactyle has some affinity with the
lowest Mammalia, which approach nearest to Reptiles.
The character might pass unregarded if it were not
found in more striking development in fossil Reptiles
from Cape Colony, which from having teeth like
Mammals are named Theriodontia. In several of
those South African reptiles the upper arm bone
approaches closer to the humerus in Ornithosaurs
than to Ornithorhynchus. Such coincidences of
structure are sometimes dismissed from consideration
and placed beyond investigation by being termed
adaptive modifications; but there can be no hope
of finding community of habit between the burrowing
Monotreme, the short-limbed Theriodont, and
the flying Pterodactyle which might have caused
this articular part of the upper arm bone to acquire
a form so similar in animals constructed so differently.
If the resemblance in the humerus to Monotremes
in this respect is not to be attributed to
burrowing, neither can the crescent form of its upper
articulation be attributed to flight; for in Birds the
head of the bone is compressed, but always convex,
and Bats fly without any approach to the Pterodactyle
form in the head of the humerus. This
apparently trivial character may from such comparisons
be inferred to be something which the way
of life of the animal does not sufficiently account for.
These deepest-seated parts of the limbs are slow to
adapt themselves to changing circumstances of existence,
and retain their characters with moderate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
variation of the bones in each of the orders or classes
of animals. It therefore is safer to regard Mammalian
characters, as well as the resemblances which
Pterodactyles show to other kinds of animals, as due
to inheritance from a time when there was a common
stock from which none of these animals which have
been considered had been distinctly elaborated.</p>

<p>A few characters of Ornithosaurs are regarded as
having been acquired, because they are not found
in any other animals, or have been developed only
in a portion of the group. The most obvious of
these is the elongated wing finger; but in some
genera, like Dimorphodon, there is also a less elongation
of the fifth digit of the foot, and perhaps in
all genera there is a backward development of the
first digit of the hand, which is without a claw, and
therefore unlike the clawed digit of a Bat. An
acquired character of another kind, which is limited
to the Cretaceous genera, is seen in the shoulder-blade
being directed transversely outward, so that
its truncated end articulates by a true joint with the
early vertebr&aelig; of the back, and defended the cavity
inclosed by the ribs by a strong bony external arch.
And finally, as the animals later in time acquire short
tails, and relatively longer limbs, the bones of the
back of the hand, termed metacarpals, acquire
greater and distinctive length, which is not seen in
the long-tailed types like Rhamphorhynchus.</p>

<p>These and such-like acquired characters distinguish
the class of animals from all groups with
which it may be compared, and mark the possible
limits of variation of the skeleton within the
boundary of the order. But no further variation of
these parts of the skeleton could make a transition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
to another order of animals, or explain how the
Pterodactyles came into existence, because the characters
which separate orders and classes of animals
from each other differ in kind from those which
separate smaller groups, named genera and species,
of which the order is made up. The accumulation
of the characters of genera will not sum up into the
characters of an order or class.</p>

<p>In making the division of Vertebrate animals into
classes the skeleton is often almost ignored. Its
value is entirely empirical and based upon the
observed association of the various forms of bones
with the more important characters of the brain and
other vital organs. What is understood as a Mammalian
or Avian character in the skeleton is the form
of bone which is found in association with the soft
vital organs which constitute an animal a Mammal
or a Bird.</p>

<p>The characters which theoretically define a Mammal
appear to be the enormous overgrowth of the cerebral
hemispheres of the brain by which the cerebrum
comes into contact with the cerebellum, as among
Birds. This character distinguishes both groups of
animals from all Reptiles, recent and fossil. But in
examining the mould of the interior of the brain
case it is rare to have the bones fitting so closely
to the brain as to prove that the lateral expansion
below the cerebrum and cerebellum is formed by
the optic lobes of the brain. Otherwise the brain
of a Pterodactyle might be as like to the brain of
Ornithorhynchus as it is like that of a Bird (<a href="#Fig_19">Fig. 19</a>).
But it is precisely in this condition of arrangement
of the parts of the brain that the specimens appear
to be most clear. The lateral mass of brain in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
specimens of Ornithosaurs from the Lower Secondary
rocks appears to be transversely divided into back
and front parts, which may be thought to correspond
to the structures in a Mammal brain named
<i>corpora quadrigemina</i>, but to be placed as the optic
lobes are placed in Birds, and to have relatively
greater dimensions than in Mammals. No evidence
has been observed of this transverse division of the
optic lobes of the brain in Pterodactyles from the
Chalk and Cretaceous rocks, and so far as the evidence
goes this part of the brain was shaped as in birds,
but rather smaller.</p>

<p>The brain is the only soft organ in which a Mammalian
character could be evidenced. The uniformity
in character of the brain throughout the group in
Mammals is remarkable, in reference to the circumstance
that the reproduction varies in type; the lowest,
or Monotreme division, being oviparous. If there is
no necessary connexion between the Mammalian
brain and the prevalent condition under which the
young are produced alive, it may be affirmed also
that there is no necessary connexion between the
form of the brain and the form of the bones, since
the brain cavity in Theriodont reptiles shows no
resemblance to that of a Mammal, while the bones
are in so many respects only paralleled among
Monotremata and Mammalia. The variety of forms
which the existing Mammalian orders of animals
assume, shows the astonishing range of structure of
the skeleton which may coexist with the Mammalian
brain. And therefore we are led to the conclusion
that any other fundamental modification of brain&mdash;such
as distinguishes the class of Birds&mdash;might also
be associated with forms and structures of the skele<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>ton
which would vary in similar ways. In other
words, if for convenience we define a Mammal by
its form of brain, structure of the heart and lungs,
and provision for nutrition of the young, without
regard to the covering of the skin, which varies
between the scales of a pangolin and the practically
naked skin of the whale&mdash;a bird might be also
defined by its peculiar conditions of brain and lungs,
without reference to the feathered condition of the
skin, though the feathered condition extends backward
in time to the Upper Secondary rocks, as seen
in the Arch&aelig;opteryx.</p>

<p>The Avian characters of Pterodactyles are the predominant
parts of their organisation, for the conditions
of the brain and lungs shown by the moulds
of the brain case and the thin hollow bones with
conspicuous pneumatic foramina, give evidence of
a community of vital structures with Birds, which
is supported by characters of the skeleton. If any
classificational value can be associated with the distribution
of the pneumatic foramina as tending to
establish membership of the same class for animals
fashioned on the same plan of soft organs, the
evidence is not weakened when a community of
structures is found to extend among the bones to
such distinctive parts of the skeleton as the sternum,
shoulder-girdle, bones of the fore-arm and fore-leg;
for in all these regions the Pterodactyle bones are
practically indistinguishable from those of Birds.
This is the more remarkable because other parts of
the skeleton, such as the humerus and pelvis, show
a partial resemblance to Birds, while the parts which
are least Avian, like the neck bones, have no tendency
to vary the number of the vertebr&aelig;, in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
way which is common among Birds, following more
closely the formula of the seven cervical vertebr&aelig; of
Mammals.</p>

<p>It would therefore appear from the vital community
of structures with Birds, that Pterodactyles
and Birds are two parallel groups, which may be
regarded as ancient divergent forks of the same
branch of animal life, which became distinguished
from each other by acquiring the different condition
of the skin, and the structures which were developed
in consequence of the bony skeleton ministering to
flight in different ways; and with different habit of
terrestrial progression, this extinct group of animals
acquired some modifications of the skeleton which
Birds have not shown. There is nothing to suggest
that Pterodactyles are a branch from Birds, but their
relation to Birds is much closer, so far as the skeleton
goes, than is their relation with the flightless Dinosaurs,
with which Birds and Pterodactyles have many
characters in common.</p>

<p>On the theory of elimination of character which
I have used to account for the disappearance of some
Mammalian characters from the Pterodactyle, that
loss is seen chiefly in the removal of the parts which
have left a Reptilian articulation of the lower jaw
with the skull, and the articulation of the vertebr&aelig;
throughout the vertebral column by a modified cup-and-ball
form of joint. The furculum of the Bird is
always absent from the Pterodactyle. No specimen
has shown recognisable clavicles or collar-bones.
Judged by the standard of existing life, Pterodactyles
belong to the same group as Birds, on the
evidence of brain and lungs, but they belong to
a different group on account of the dissimilar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
modifications of the skeleton and apparent absence
of feathers from the skin.</p>

<p>The most impressive facts in the Pterodactyle
skeleton, in view of these affinities, are the structures
which it has in common with Reptiles. Some structures
are fundamental, like the cup-and-ball articulation
of the vertebr&aelig;, which is never found in birds
or mammals. Although not quite identical with the
condition in any Reptile, this structure is approximately
Lizard-like or Crocodile-like in the cup-and-ball
character. It shows that the deepest-seated part
of the skeleton is Reptile-like, though it may not be
more Reptilian than is the vertebral column of a
Mammal, if comparison is made between Mammals
and extinct groups of animals known as Reptiles,
such as Dinosaurs and Theriodontia.</p>

<p>The orders of animals which have been included
under the name Reptilia comprise such different
structural conditions of the parts of the skeleton
which may be termed reptilian in Ornithosaurs, that
there is good reason for regarding the cup-and-ball
articulation as quite a distinctive Reptilian specialisation,
in the same sense that the saddle-shaped articulation
between the bodies of adjacent vertebr&aelig; in
a bird is an Avian specialisation. From the theoretical
point of view the Ornithosaur acquired its Reptilian
characters simultaneously with its Avian and Mammalian
characters.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the structure of the skeleton
of the Dinosauria, to which Ornithosaurs approximate
in several parts of the body, which would help to
explain the cup-and-ball articulation of the backbone,
if the Flying Reptile were supposed to be an offshoot
from the carnivorous Dinosaurs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>The elimination of Reptile characters from so much
of the skeleton, and the substitution for them of the
characters of Birds and Mammals, would be of exceptional
interest if there had been any ground for
regarding the flying animal as more nearly related to
a Reptile than to a Bird. But if the evidence from
the form of the brain and nature of the pneumatic
organs seen in the limb bones accounts for the Avian
features of the skeleton, the Reptilian condition of the
vertebral column helps to show a capacity for variation,
and that the fixity of type and structure, which
the skeleton of the modern Bird has attained, is not
necessarily limited to or associated with the vital
organs of Birds.</p>

<p>The variation of the cup-and-ball articulation in
the neck of a Chelonian, which makes the third
vertebra cupped behind, the fourth bi-convex, the
fifth cupped in front, and the sixth flattened behind,
shows that too much importance may be attached
to the mode of union of these bones in Serpents,
Crocodiles, and those Lizards which have the cup in
front; for while in Lizards the anterior cup, oblique and
depressed, is found in most of its groups, the Geckos
show no trace of the cup-and-ball structure, and in
that respect resemble the Hatteria of New Zealand.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the cup-and-ball articulation of vertebr&aelig;
in Ornithosauria has any significance as a mark
of affinity to Reptiles, it could only be in approximation
to those living Reptiles which possess the same
character, and would have it on the hypothesis that
both have preserved the structure by descent from an
earlier type of animal. This hypothesis is negatived
by the fact that the cup-and-ball articulation is unknown
in the older fossil Reptiles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>Although the articulation for the lower jaw with
the skull in Ornithosaurs is only to be paralleled
among Reptiles, the structure is adapted to a brain
case which is practically indistinguishable from that
of a Bird, except for the postorbital arch.</p>

<p>The hypothesis of descent, therefore, becomes impossible,
in any intelligible form, in explanation
of distinctive character of the skeleton. The hypothesis
of elimination may also seem to be insufficient,
unless the potential capacity for new development be
recognised as concurrent, and as capable of modifying
each region of the skeleton, or hard parts of the
animal, in the same way that the soft organs may be
modified. From which we infer that all structures,
which distinguish the several grades of organisation
in modern classifications, soft parts and hard parts
alike, may come into existence together, in so far
as they are compatible with each other, in any class
or ordinal division of animals.</p>

<p>Although the young Mammal passes through a
stage of growth in which the brain may be said to be
Reptilian, there is no good ground for inferring that
Mammal or Bird type of skeleton was developed later
in time than that of Reptiles. The various types of
Fishes have the brains in general so similar to those
of Reptiles that it is more intelligible for all the
vertebrate forms of brain to have differentiated at
the same time, under the law of elimination of characters,
than that there should be any other bond of
union between the classes of animals.</p>

<p>If we ask what started the Ornithosauria into
existence, and created the plan of construction of
that animal type, I think science is justified in boldly
affirming that the initial cause can only be sought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
under the development of patagial membranes, such
as have been seen in various animals ministering to
flight. Such membranes, in an animal which was
potentially a Bird in its vital organs, have owed development
to the absence of quill feathers. Thus
the wing membrane may be the cause for the chief
differences of the skeleton by which Ornithosaurs
are separated from Birds, for the stretch of wing in
one case is made by the skin attached to the bones,
and in the other case by feathers on the skin so
attached as to necessitate that the wing bones have
different proportions from Ornithosaurs.</p>

<p>It is a well-known observation that each great
epoch of geological time has had its dominant forms
of animal life, which, so far as the earth's history is
known now, came into existence, lived their time,
and were seen no more. In the same way the
smaller groups of species and genera included in an
ordinal group of animals or class have abounded,
giving a tone to the life of each geological formation,
until the vitality of the animal is exhausted, and the
species becomes extinct or ceases to preponderate.
This process is seen to be still modifying the life on
the earth, when some kinds of animals and plants
are introduced to new conditions. Plants appear to
wage successful war more easily than animals. The introduction
of the Cactus in some parts of Cape Colony
has locally modified both the fauna and flora, just
as the Anacharis introduced into England spread
from Cambridge over the whole country, and became
for many years the predominant form of plant life
in the streams. The Rabbit in Australia is a historic
pest. Something similar to this physical fertility
and increase appears to take place under new cir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>cumstances
in certain organs within the bodies of
animals, by the development of structures previously
unknown. A familiar example is seen in the internal
anatomy of the Trout introduced into New Zealand,
where the number of pyloric appendages about the
stomach has become rapidly augmented, while the
size and the form of the animal have changed. The
rapidity with which some of these changes have been
brought about would appear to show that Nature is
capable of transforming animals more rapidly than
might have been inferred from their uniform life
under ordinary circumstances. Growth of the vital
organs in this way may modify the distinctive form
of any vital organ, brain or lungs, and thus as a consequence
of modification of the internal structures due
to changes of food and habit, bring a new group of
animals into existence. And just as the group of
animals ceases to predominate after a time, so there
comes a limit to the continued internal development
of vital structures as their energy fails, for each organ
behaves to some extent like an independent organism.</p>

<p>Under such explanations of the mutual relations of
the parts of animals, and groups of animals, time
ceases to be a factor of primary importance in their
construction or elaboration. The supposed necessity
for practically unlimited time to produce changes in
the vital organs which separate animals into great
orders or classes is a nightmare, born of hypothesis,
and may be profitably dismissed. The geological
evidence is too imperfect for dogmatism on speculative
questions; but the nature of the affinities of
Ornithosaurs to other animals has been established
on a basis of comparison which has no need of
theory to justify the facts. It is not improbable that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
the primary epoch of time, even as known at present,
may be sufficiently long to contain the parent races
from which Ornithosaurs and all their allies have
arisen.</p>

<p>In thus stating the relation of Ornithosaurs to
other animals the Flying Reptile has been traced
home to kindred, though not to its actual parents or
birthplace. There is no geological history of the
rapid or gradual development of the wing finger, and
although the wing membrane may be accepted as
its cause of existence, the wing finger is powerfully
developed in the oldest known Pterodactyles as in
their latest representatives.</p>

<p>Pterodactyles show singularly little variation in
structure in their geological history. We chronicle
the loss of the tail and loss of teeth. There is also
the loss of the outermost wing digit from the hind
foot as a supporter of the wing membrane. But the
other variations are in the length of the metacarpus,
or of the neck, or head. One of the fundamental
laws of life necessitates that when an animal type
ceases to adapt its organisation and modify its
structures to suit the altered circumstances forced
upon it by revolutions of the earth's surface its life's
history becomes broken. It must bend or break.</p>

<p>The final disappearance of these animals from the
earth's history in the Chalk may yet be modified
by future discoveries, but the Flying Reptiles have
vanished, in the same way as so many other groups
of animals which were contemporary with them in
the Secondary period of time. Such extinctions
have been attributed to catastrophes, like the submergence
of land, so that the habitations of animals
became an area gradually decreasing in size, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
at last disappeared. It appears also to be a law of
life, illustrated by many extinct groups of animals,
that they endure for geological ages, and having
fought their battle in life's history, grow old and unable
to continue the fight, and then disappear from
the earth, giving place to more vigorous types adapted
to live under new conditions.</p>

<p>The extinct Pterodactyles hold a relation to Birds
in the scheme of life not unlike that which Monotremata
hold to other Mammals. Both are remarkable
for the variety of their affinities and resemblances
to Reptiles. The Ornithosauria have long passed
away; the Monotremes are nearing extinction. Both
appear to be supplanted by parallel groups which
were their contemporaries. Birds now fill the earth
in a way that Flying Reptiles never surpassed; but
their flight is made in a different manner, and the
wing is extended to support the animal in the air,
chiefly by appendages to the skin.</p>

<p>If these fossils have taught that Ornithosaurs have
a community of soft vital organs with Dinosaurs and
Birds, they have also gone some way towards proving
that causes similar to those which determined the
structural peculiarities of their bony framework,
originated the special forms of respiratory organs
and brain which lifted them out of association with
existing Reptiles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These old flying animals sleep through geological
ages, not without honour, for the study of their story
has illuminated the mode of origin of animals which
survive them, and in cleaving the rocks to display
their bones we have opened a new page of the book
of life.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
